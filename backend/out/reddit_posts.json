    "content": "🍎 **Is Tim Cook preparing to step down as Apple’s CEO?** — What ProBors data and reports suggest 👀\n\n**Body:**\n\nRumors are once again swirling around **Tim Cook’s future at Apple**.  \nA recent *Daily Mail* article raised the question of whether Cook might be **ready to step aside**, and Bloomberg’s latest report adds weight to the idea that **Apple is quietly planning for succession**.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, **John Ternus**, Apple’s Senior VP of Hardware Engineering, is the **leading internal candidate** to eventually take over the CEO role. He’s become increasingly visible during product launches and is said to have Cook’s full confidence.\n\nAt the same time, **Apple’s leadership reshuffle is already underway** — longtime COO **Jeff Williams** has announced his retirement, with **Sabih Khan** stepping into the role. This aligns with Apple’s long-term pattern of evolving leadership gradually rather than through sudden shake-ups.\n\n\n\n# 🧩 Why Cook might step down (and why maybe not just yet)\n\n**Reasons it could happen soon:**\n\n* Cook turns 65 soon — it wouldn’t be unusual for him to begin a structured hand-off.\n* Internal succession planning at Apple is well-known and meticulous.\n\n**Reasons it might** ***not*** **happen yet:**\n\n* Apple is entering another big innovation cycle (AI, Vision Pro 2, new silicon). Cook may want to see those through.\n* The company remains extremely stable under his leadership.\n* There’s no official signal from Apple or the SEC that a transition is imminent.\n\n\n\n# 💼 Who could replace him?\n\n* **John Ternus** is widely seen as the natural successor — technically brilliant, calm under pressure, and already representing Apple in major keynotes.\n* Other internal leaders like Craig Federighi or Sabih Khan are also strong figures, but less likely based on current visibility.\n\n\n\n# 📈 ProBors Insight\n\nTim Cook remains a highly active insider: his most recent **Form 4 filing** shows a **sale of 129,963 AAPL shares** (\\~$33.4 million).  \nWhile his trades are typically scheduled and part of his long-term compensation plan, they still serve as valuable reference points for **insider-pattern analysis** across the tech sector.\n\n\n\nApple may not confirm anything until the very last moment — but signals point to **a carefully staged leadership transition** already in motion.  \nWhen Cook does step down, it will mark one of the most significant CEO shifts in tech history.\n\n\n\n📈 *Source: ProBors – Tracking insider, politician & whale trades*  \n📋 *Data: Bloomberg, Daily Mail*",

    "content": "I've been looking for plays that are de-risking themselves while the rest of the market is choppy, and this one keeps popping up on my radar. It's a diagnostics company that has been quietly building major momentum in Europe while setting up its main show for the US.\n\nThe ticker is MYNZ (Mainz Biomed), and here's the quick cheat sheet on why it's worth a look right now, especially on market dips:\n\n1. Europe is Launching Now\n\nThey just secured UK market authorization (MHRA registration) for their flagship colorectal cancer (CRC) test, ColoAlert. That's a huge potential market! Plus, they officially launched commercially in Switzerland in September. This isn't future hope—it's execution that should start showing up in revenue soon.\n\n2. The US Path is Clear\n\nThe big one is their next-gen CRC test. They've given a clear roadmap:\n\n* Data Readout Coming: They plan to release the main results from their key clinical study (eAArly DETECT 2) in Q4 2025. This is the core catalyst everyone is waiting for.\n* Pivotal Study Next: That data will finalize the design for the big US pivotal study (ReconAAsense), which is set to start in 2026. This is the FDA pathway in action.\n\n3. Smart Expansion Beyond CRC\n\nThey aren't a one-trick pony. They're already working on a non-invasive, blood-based screening test for pancreatic cancer (PancAlert). The best part? They secured government funding to cover up to 50% of the project costs, which takes the pressure off their cash burn.\n\nWhile most pennies today are struggling to find a \"second leg\" without real news, MYNZ is checking boxes with real execution in Europe and has a massive Q4 2025 data catalyst looming for the US market.\n\nIn a slow session like this, I'm not chasing thin floats. I'd rather use weakness to build a position in a story that has a clear roadmap and fresh receipts, like MYNZ.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Are you looking for execution stories or sticking to technical-only plays today?\n\n\n\nPCSA JNJ NISN DRCT TOVX DELL VIVK AAPL ADBE AKAN OPEN IREN WDC EGAN LPTX NKE SOPA SOFI COCH BNAI STX ARBE AMD RKLB RYDE FLUT PHOE PRHI GSIW QCOM AEI COIN AMZN ANET DLXY ASTS CIIT ZNB ANY BURU CLRB BQ MARA AREC BKNG NOW CRM DVLT EDHL QS SHOP VRT RVSN QNCX ACHR EDSA TSLA FOFO OKUR ZBIO XBIO RNAZ LXEO SCWO CRVO SKYE BJDX YYAI BIAF CCTG YDKG CRWD BAC BGL APM LBGJ DSY CCTG INTU MTEN BA GLTO QTTB MRVL ANIX QUBT",

It’s not just luck - PancAlert’s 100% sensitivity/95% specificity with precancer detection and a plan for NGS to PCR validation boosts the story. Plus, Q4 2025 CRC data preps a 2026 pivotal, with ColoAlert live in the U.K., Switzerland, and Germany.\n\nUnlike MSS, TLIH, and SURG, which faded, MYNZ had buyers at key levels. If $1.60 holds as a pivot and EU updates (U.K., Swiss, German channels) hit, this relative strength could spark a move to $1.70 or $2 when the market chills. You seeing MYNZ breaking out soon?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nOKLO NXXT BA AVTX BJDX MIGI PFE HOWL UNH ZBIO WDC NVDA DEVS GSIT RITR CCTG LPTX CSCO NBIS GLBZ AREC COIN CLIR UPC RNAZ RVPH TOVX DRCT PM AMBI WETH MSPR HKPD INTU QUBT BE BKNG HCWB SKYE NEE DELL MSN BKSY TRX TJX AMLX CLYM GLTO EGAN IPSC DKNG PWM AREB CRDO FBLG ZNB GPUS ASTS SLGL SDOT LLY SPHL JZXN PANW ORCL IQST ENGS SOPA BNAI AEHR MARA SHMD EDSA LBGJ ANET MU SRPT POET DRMA TMO CRCL NISN RGC LINK SPRB CISS ASNS HIT ICE CRWD TNMG MGIH CRM NXL DDC YDKG",

I kept my focus on NASDAQ: МYNZ because it’s one of the few with near-dated, definable milestones and fresh validation. The pancreatic program just hit 100%/95% in feasibility with precancer detection, and the roadmap is designed for adoption move from NGS discovery to PCR validation where hospital labs already live.\n\nMore importantly, the Q4 CRC top-line is still on the clock to finalize protocols for a 2026 pivotal (ReconAAsense). That means you don’t have to wait years for a shot at re-rating. Technically, reclaiming \\~$1.60 after the morning wobble gives a clean risk marker; above it, $1.68–$1.72 is the next test. In a sea of red with no clear catalysts, I’ll take relative strength plus a calendar over hope trades.",

    "content": "Apple red, Intel red, NEON and IXHL red, felt like everything risk was leaning lower. The outlier for me was NASDAQ: MYNZ, which quietly reclaimed the $1.60 area and held green into midday. That’s not random: the story just got a fundamental boost with pancreatic feasibility (100% sensitivity / 95% specificity, precancer detection) and a clear path to scale, larger retrospective study (NGS) → PCR validation.\n\nWhat I care about on days like this is signal vs noise. MSS, TLIH, and SURG all faded with the tape; MYNZ had buyers at known levels and a catalyst calendar that hasn’t changed. Near term: Q4 top-line for the next-gen CRC study to set a 2026 pivotal. If $1.60 acts as a pivot and we see any EU commercialization receipts (UK/CH/DE), it’s the kind of relative strength that often gets rewarded once the market tone improves.",

    "content": "Yesterday's dip was a great chance to load up. I grabbed 1.5k shares around $1.37 and I'm holding, looking for a quick rebound back up to the $1.70-$1.75 area.\n\nWhy I think this swing trade has legs: Mainz Biomed (MYNZ) has had some seriously good news that seems to be getting ignored:\n\n1. They just launched in two new countries: Their cancer test, ColoAlert, officially went live for commercial sales in Switzerland on September 23, 2025. This is real revenue kicking in now. Plus, they got full market authorization for the whole U.K. on September 2, 2025. That opens up a huge new market for their partner there.\n2. Big U.S. catalyst ahead: The main event is the data readout for their next-gen test, eAArly DETECT 2. They promised top-line results in Q4 2025 (that's right around the corner!). This data is the key to their big U.S. clinical study starting in 2026.\n\nThe drop yesterday looks like an overreaction. Given the new commercial launches in Europe and the major U.S. data coming up this quarter, the stock has strong reasons to move back up.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is the swing back to the mid-$1.70s realistic?\n\n  \nSLNH SENS SLMT ACET ORCL DRMA STRO AAPL ASNS LPTX MARA DDC QS NAOV APVO RNTX SPHL AGMH MSGY ACXP PYPL ANY IPSC ZBIO BCG BQ CRDO CHR CRWD FLUT POLA DGNX THH GILD RGC BE PM HTCO BURU SOPA BKNG UPC BTM VRT OKLO FTEL YYAI NEE PFE ASTS FOFO DGNX LXEO GLBZ BRLT CSCO XELB DRMA PALI LYRA NOW SNWV PCSA DEVS SNOW ICE CRCL ADBE BIAF CRML INBS COST AUST RYDE F NBIS DELL XBIO MSN SES AMLX CLRB POET MGIH OKUR STX TCRT GSIT AREB CRWV COCH MP GEV EDHL PUBM HIMS NERV REKR IQST SHFS AEHR QBTS VELO BAOS SMTK ",

    "content": "\\- According to the expert, neoclouds are preferred for AI workloads because their infrastructure is purpose-built for high-performance computing. Unlike hyperscalers, which rely on legacy network designs optimized for general cloud use, neoclouds feature low-latency, high-bandwidth networks, often using InfiniBand, tailored specifically for GPU-intensive AI tasks. Neoclouds offer a more efficient and specialized environment for AI, making them increasingly attractive to both [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click) and enterprise customers.  \n  \n\\- The expert explains that while, hyperscalers provide valuable high-level AI services, they can create vendor lock-in. [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click)'s acquisition of Lepton and the rebranding of DGX Cloud to DGX Cloud Lepton enables customers to manage and unify AI workloads across multiple environments, whether in [$CRWV](https://x.com/search?q=%24CRWV&src=cashtag_click), [$AMZN](https://x.com/search?q=%24AMZN&src=cashtag_click), or [$MSFT](https://x.com/search?q=%24MSFT&src=cashtag_click), giving users more control and mobility, much to the frustration of traditional cloud providers.  \n  \n\\- The expert explains that [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click)'s strategy to buy compute back from neoclouds after selling them chips is not just about keeping its balance sheet capital-light, it's also about focusing its resources on core competencies like chip design and testing. Managing physical data centers involves significant overhead, including staffing, power, cooling, and maintenance, which [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click) prefers to avoid. The expert adds that [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click) partners with multiple neoclouds, such as [$CRWV](https://x.com/search?q=%24CRWV&src=cashtag_click) and [$NBIS](https://x.com/search?q=%24NBIS&src=cashtag_click) not only to diversify risk but also because no single provider is currently large enough to meet all of [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click)'s internal compute needs.  \n  \n\\- The expert underscores CUDA's unmatched role in GPU programming, highlighting not only its broad compatibility across past, present, and future [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click) GPUs, but also its unique ability to improve performance on older hardware over time. Unlike typical software that slows down older devices, CUDA updates actually optimize legacy GPUs, making them faster with each release. This backward-compatible and forward-enhancing design allows developers to benefit from new CUDA features without rewriting code, even as GPU architectures evolve.",

We’re 100% a windows shop but there are a lot of complaints about our dell laptops (me included) and from my job’s perspective I would really rather have a Mac at the helm to work on. I see a lot of larger companies deploy macs as their workstations to employees so I know it can be done, I just have no idea what their IT team is doing to manage or configure them to abide by their corporate standards.\n\nAre they using something different than AD to manage them? Is it a weird configuration? How can I convince my IT team to at least *explore* issuing Macs instead of windows laptops to us while we are using AD? \n\nThanks in advance. ",

By enabling it, administrators can lock the UI language to a specific choice—such as English—regardless of what other languages are installed or preferred by individual users. \n\nThis ensures that menus, dialogs, and system prompts appear in the same language for everyone, which helps reduce confusion, streamline training, and improve support efficiency. It’s especially useful in global organizations or educational institutions where standardization is key to maintaining clarity and productivity.\n\nThe policy can be deployed through Intune using the Settings Catalog or via a custom OMA-URI configuration. Admins create a profile, enable the setting under Time Language Settings, assign it to relevant groups, and verify deployment through Intune’s portal or Event Viewer logs. If needed, the policy can be edited or removed easily. \n\nFor advanced users, registry paths and Group Policy mappings are also provided to align with traditional management methods.

    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nYesterday was wild for this stock. We saw a huge dip, then a massive 28% bounce back. I grabbed 1,500 shares near the bottom at $1.37 and I'm holding.\n\nI think this could easily push back up to the old range around $1.71-$1.75. That would be a nice quick swing trade.\n\nWhy the sudden confidence? Check the recent news! This company, Mainz Biomed (MYNZ), has been racking up wins in Europe.\n\n* They just launched their main cancer test in Switzerland (Sept 23, 2025). That means real money coming in from a new country now, not later.\n* They also got regulatory approval to sell in the U.K. (Sept 2, 2025) a huge market.\n* Plus, they locked in the timeline for their next-gen test data (Q4 2025) which is key for their path to the U.S. FDA.\n\nIt looks like the fundamentals are getting stronger right as the price is trying to recover.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is this just a dead cat bounce, or does the recent news give it the fuel to keep climbing?\n\n  \nJZXN RKT WETH V ACHR ACN SHOP LBGJ RKLB SLGL BNAI MU MIGI PC MA JNJ SOFI WBX TMO RNAZ ULY EGAN NISN BKSY SDOT PG BRN APP MSFT QNCX DRCT BA RITR SGLY HOOD DKNG IONQ GOOG ENGS SRPT BKKT SOPA IREN LINK BMNR OPEN COIN AMAT BURU SLNH SHMD GS AMBI BGL SPRB FPAY IMXI HCWB LRCX DLXY VZ DSY ASTS NITO TJX AVTX TOVX AGRZ HKPD AKAN ANET POET CIIT NXL RKLB TXN PRHI MRVL CAT AVGO NFLX YDKG VYNE QTTB QMCO PMAX CHAI TSLA ",

    "content": "MAG7:\n\n* NVDA - Cantor Fitzgerald raises PT to 300 from 240, which is a new Street High. A particular spotlight during this trip was the company’s new partnership with OpenAI, where they aim to stand it up as its own self-hosted hyperscaler. The vision is to remove margin stacking by server ODMs and CSPs, narrowing the cost delta between NVDA and ASICs to only around 15%—a win-win for both and a potential source of further pressure on the ASIC market. NVIDIA continues to work at Extreme Co-Design on an annual cadence, optimizing the entire AI infrastructure through a full-stack solution including CUDA-X.\n* Put simply, Jensen and the team are as focused and competitive as ever, and they are playing to win. We do not see a scenario where NVDA fails to secure at least 75% of the AI accelerator market over time.

Additionally, there is still opacity as to how much crossover exists with legal betting markets and customer databases, and the legality of the product is far from certain. As a result, we think the sell-off is overdone.\n* OKLO - Canaccord Genuity initiates with Buy rating PT 175. The world needs greater supplies of clean, baseload power; while rising AI demand may influence the growth trajectory, we anticipate strong long-term demand for nuclear energy regardless. Set against this backdrop of likely extraordinary momentum, a new wave of energy leaders is beginning to take shape—each poised to leave its own distinctive mark. And we see Oklo emerging as one; a vertically integrated, global distributed nuclear energy utility—breaking down barriers by closing the loop.\"\n* BE - HSBC downgrades to Hold from Buy, raises PT to 100 from 44. Our USD100.00 TP implies 14.2% upside, and we downgrade to Hold from a Buy rating previously. While we see tremendous upside for the company and expect consensus estimates to revise higher, we await a better entry point for the shares\n* TSMC - TSMC Q3 revenue totaled NT$989.9B, above consensus NT$973.3B, while YTD revenue reached NT$2.76T, up 36.4% YoY, though marking the 2nd straight month of decelerating growth pace\n* BABA - PT lowered to $240 from $245 at JPMorgan\n* BABA - PT raised to 200 from 195 at BofA\n* APLD - Applied Digital price target raised to $35 from $18 at Citizens JMP",

    "content": "The article outlines how organizations can enhance user privacy on Windows devices by disabling the Windows Advertising ID using Microsoft Intune. This ID, while not inherently a security risk, allows apps and ad networks to track user behavior for personalized advertising, which can be problematic in corporate environments. \n\nBy configuring a policy through Intune’s Settings Catalog, IT admins can centrally disable this feature across all managed devices, ensuring consistent privacy standards without relying on users to adjust settings manually. The process involves selecting the Windows platform, choosing the appropriate profile type, and enabling the “Disable Advertising ID” setting under the Privacy category.\n\nOnce the policy is created, it can be assigned to specific device groups and monitored for successful deployment via the Intune portal or Event Viewer logs. The article also explains how to remove or delete the policy if needed and provides advanced configuration options using OMA-URI for custom deployments. \n\nThis centralized control not only protects user data but also reduces unnecessary background activity from ad services, potentially improving system performance. Overall, the guide empowers IT professionals to implement privacy-focused configurations efficiently using Intune’s built-in tools.\n\n\\[New Post\\] 🎯Control Windows Advertising ID for Enhanced Privacy using Intune\n\n🔥Windows Advertising ID Policy\n\n🔥Real Word Example of Advertising ID Policy\n\n🔥Helps to Enhance Privacy\n\n🔥How this Policy Helps Admins\n\n🔥Prevent Ads tracking\n\n🔥Client-Side Behavior\n\n🔐 Purpose of the Policy\n\nWindows Advertising ID is a unique, resettable identifier used by apps and ad networks for personalized advertising.\n\nWhile not a direct security threat, it can be used to profile user behavior—raising privacy concerns, especially on corporate devices.\n\nIntune allows organizations to centrally disable this ID to enhance privacy and reduce external tracking.\n\n🛠️ Configuration Steps in Intune\n\nCreate a New Policy Go to Devices > Configuration > +Create > +New Policy in Intune Admin Center.\n\nSelect Platform and Profile Type\n\nPlatform: Windows 10 and later\n\nProfile Type: Settings Catalog\n\nBasic Tab\n\nAdd a name (mandatory) and description (optional).\n\nConfiguration Settings\n\nUse the Settings Picker to browse by category → select Privacy → choose Disable Advertising ID Policy.\n\nChoose Policy Value\n\nEnabled: Turns off the advertising ID (recommended for privacy).\n\nDisabled/Not Configured: Users can control the setting manually.\n\nScope Tags & Group Assignment\n\nOptional: Add scope tags.\n\nAssign the policy to specific user/device groups.\n\nReview + Create\n\nVerify all settings before clicking Create.\n\n📊 Monitoring & Validation\n\nMonitoring Status: Check policy deployment success in Intune Portal.\n\nEvent Viewer: Look for Event ID 813 under Application and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > DeviceManagement-Enterprise-Diagnostics-Provider > Admin.\n\n🧹 Policy Removal & Deletion\n\nRemove Assigned Groups: Edit the policy in Intune and update assignments.\n\nDelete Policy: Navigate to the Configuration section and delete it to remove from devices.\n\n🔧 Advanced Configuration (OMA-URI)\n\nFor custom deployment, use OMA-URI: ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Privacy/DisableAdvertisingId\n\nValue: 65535 (default for disabling)\n\nThis is the new post published in HTMD Community [AnoopCNair.com](http://AnoopCNair.com) website and this is related to Control Windows Advertising ID for Enhanced Privacy using Intune.\n\nRead Full Article - [https://www.anoopcnair.com/windows-advertising-id-for-privacy-using-intune/](https://www.anoopcnair.com/windows-advertising-id-for-privacy-using-intune/)\n\n\\#Intune #MSIntune #HTMDCommunity",

    "content": "This Intune policy allows IT administrators to control whether Windows apps—especially Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps—can access users’ email data. By configuring the “Let Apps Access Email” setting, organizations can enforce strict data protection rules to prevent unauthorized apps from reading corporate emails. \n\nAdmins can apply the policy globally or tailor it per app using the app’s Package Family Name, retrieved via PowerShell. The available options include letting users decide, forcing access, or denying access entirely—each with implications for user experience and security posture.\n\nThe setup process in Intune is straightforward: create a configuration profile, select the Windows platform, and use the Settings Catalog to apply the email access policy. Once deployed, admins can monitor policy status via the Intune portal and verify client-side enforcement using Event Viewer logs (specifically Event ID 813). \n\nThe policy supports Windows 10 version 1607 and later and can also be configured using OMA-URI for granular control. This approach ensures that only trusted apps—like managed Outlook clients or internal tools—can interact with sensitive email data, reinforcing Zero Trust principles and minimizing data leakage risks.\n\n\\[New Post\\] 🎯Control Windows Apps Access Email to Preventing Data Leakage using Intune\n\n🔥Windows Apps Access Email Policy\n\n🔥Real Word Example of Windows Apps Access Email Policy\n\n🔥Helps to Preventing Data Leakage\n\n🔥How this Policy Helps Admins\n\n🔥Improve Productivity\n\n🔥Client-Side Behavior\n\n🛡️ Purpose of the Policy\n\nGoal: Prevent unauthorized Windows apps from accessing corporate email data.\n\nTool: Microsoft Intune’s “Let Apps Access Email” policy.\n\nScope: Applies to Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps and other Windows apps.\n\n🧩 Step-by-Step Setup in Intune\n\nCreate Policy: Go to Devices > Windows > Configuration > Create New Policy.\n\nSelect Platform: Choose Windows 10 and later.\n\nProfile Type: Use Settings catalog.\n\nAdd Setting: Navigate to Privacy > Let Apps Access Email.\n\nAssign Groups: Target specific user/device groups.\n\nReview & Create: Finalize and deploy the policy.\n\n🔍 Monitoring & Verification\n\nIntune Portal: Check deployment status under Devices > Configuration.\n\nClient-Side: Use Event Viewer → Event ID 813 to confirm policy application.\n\n🧼 Policy Maintenance\n\nRemove Group Assignment: Edit the policy and remove assigned groups.\n\nDelete Policy: Fully remove it from Intune Portal under Configuration.\n\n🧠 Technical Details\n\nSupported OS: Windows 10 version 1607 and later.\n\nOMA-URI Path:/Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Privacy/LetAppsAccessEmail\n\n0 = User control\n\n1 = Force allows\n\n2 = Force denies\n\nThis is the new post published in HTMD Community [AnoopCNair.com](http://AnoopCNair.com) website and this is related to Control Windows Apps Access Email to Preventing Data Leakage using Intune.\n\nRead Full Article - [https://www.anoopcnair.com/windows-apps-access-email-to-using-intune/](https://www.anoopcnair.com/windows-apps-access-email-to-using-intune/)\n\n\\#Intune #MSIntune #HTMDCommunity ",

Names like Vertiv, Broadcom, and Dell have ridden the buildout cycle, with dips bought quickly—but sensitivity to valuation has climbed.\n\n**Why it matters:** If rate cuts extend the risk-on window, AI capex could run longer into 2026, keeping semis and infra bid. Watch earnings-revision breadth, cloud capex guides, energy margins, and legal headlines (e.g., MOH). On the flip side, stretched multiples and cash-burn stories (ASTS) raise drawdown risk if growth wobbles.\n\nWant quick daily breakdowns on your phone?

    "content": "Markets roared back today with a strong rebound across major indexes — the **Nasdaq** surged about **+1.1%**, the **S&P 500** gained **+0.6%**, while the **Dow** held roughly flat. The rally was fuelled by a renewed wave of **AI optimism** and easing rate expectations after recent Fed comments hinted at potential cuts later this year.   \n  \nDespite lingering concerns over a possible government shutdown, investors shrugged off macro worries and piled back into growth and tech.\n\nThe heatmap lit up green, led by semiconductors and big tech. **#AMD** exploded **+11%**, while **#NVDA** climbed **+2.2%** and **#AVGO** added **+2.7%**. **#AAPL** rose modestly at **+0.6%**, **#MSFT** edged slightly higher, **#META** ended in green while **#GOOGL** was the lone big-tech laggard, dipping **–0.5%**. Over in enterprise software, **#ORCL** and **#PLTR** gained on AI-related momentum, and in streaming, **#NFLX** tacked on nearly **+2%**.\n\n**#AMZN** led retail with a **+1.5%** pop, **#TSLA** bounced back **+1.3%**, and defensives like **#JNJ** and **#LLY** stayed steady. Finance was mostly red with **#JPM** **#BAC #WFC** and **#GS** while **#BRK.B** held firm.  \n  \nOverall, it was a risk-on day — traders rotated back into high-growth names as optimism returned to the AI trade.   \n  \nThe question now: is this the start of a new leg higher or just another frothy rally before earnings season kicks in?\n\nMoneyvize makes it easier to spot where strength and weakness are concentrated — whether you’re tracking daily movers or looking for value in recently sold-off names.

Nonetheless, Finviz stands out by allowing screenings based on candlestick and chart patterns, catering to both investors and traders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wcr435x9r6zb1.jpg?width=1273&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e25c16c31a965de1d9cb606aa9cb96c393548914\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Analysis of Finviz Charting:**\n\nFinviz provides essential daily chart pattern recognition and a select number of overlays and indicators, differentiating it from platforms like MetaStock and TradingView.

An example of its effectiveness is a system that outperformed the S&P 500 over a 25-year period, utilizing the Price Rate of Change indicator.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tips for Stock Discovery Using Finviz:**\n\nTo identify potential breakout stocks, users can apply specific screener filters like \"Price crossed MA50 above\" and \"Gap Up 5%.\" \n\nFor locating potential short-squeeze candidates, filters like \"Float Short Over 30%\" and \"Option/Short - Optionable\" are useful. \n\nHowever, Finviz does not directly offer tools for finding undervalued stocks; for such a feature, platforms like Stock Rover are recommended, which provide detailed criteria including Fair Value and Margin of Safety for value-seeking investors.",

I put a lot of work into creating fully functional, polished apps, but sometimes I see 1- or 2-star ratings come in with no comment at all.\n\nThese low ratings can really drag down the overall score, even if the vast majority of users are happy and the app works perfectly. I understand that 3–5 stars are subjective, but 1–2 stars usually indicate a real problem — yet right now Google Play doesn’t require users to leave any explanation.\n\nIt feels unfair, and it’s frustrating because there’s little recourse. Sure, you can flag reviews as inappropriate, but if it’s just a low rating without a comment, there’s rarely anything Google will remove.\n\nWouldn’t it make sense if Google Play required a short explanation when giving 1 or 2 stars? At least then we could understand the problem, respond appropriately, or flag truly inappropriate reviews.\n\nI’d love to hear from other devs — do you experience this too? How do you cope with low ratings that don’t actually reflect app quality?",

I've only been able to recreate the issue in Elden Ring.  \nThe spikes feel like other players suddenly freeze for 1–3 seconds, then teleport to their real position.  \nMy own character and game remain smooth, although I've heard some reports that my character starts to teleport around when moving which I think happens after or during the lag spikes.\n\nAt first I thought it was the game’s netcode, but I ran several tests:\n\n* Continuous ping to [8.8.8.8](http://8.8.8.8) in a command prompt → 0% loss, steady 16/17 ms latency\n* [Packetlosstest.com](http://Packetlosstest.com) → often get around 10% late packets with game open, no issues when closed\n* [Packetstats.com](http://Packetstats.com) → steady 25 to 35 ms when the game is closed, spikes of 400 or +1000 ms when game is open\n* Lag spikes happen even when Elden Ring is minimized\n* LatencyMon doesn’t report any issues\n* If launching the game offline, spikes still occur but much less frequently\n\n\n\n**What I've tried:**   \nRestarting the router, making sure the cables are plugged correctly (ethernet cord etc), updating drivers, restarting PC, reinstalling the game, changing CPU power settings to performance, excluding the game in Windows Defender, disabling overlays, limiting the bandwidth use of other apps with NetLimiter\n\n\n\nIs this a network instability (routing or ISP issue) or something local to my PC (CPU/network driver throttling, background process) and what else can I try in order to fix it ?\n\n\n\n**Screenshots / logs:**  \n[packetlosstest.com results while Elden Ring is closed](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/845772565993226250/1425881179252326504/image.png?ex=68e932d4&is=68e7e154&hm=a7587f3588f0db46d6843913cead101c73e2a917e72494ecac8a0fcd3c1ae818&)\n\n[packetlosstest.com results while Elden Ring is open](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/845772565993226250/1425881179663634472/image.png?ex=68e932d4&is=68e7e154&hm=92cf7baf6c1e6b8bf97b4654366781ab617f82d72475fae576a26bb0b1724a54&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=812&height=942)\n\n[packetstats.com while Elden Ring is open](https://prnt.sc/ELo98zCgmDZI)\n\n[packetstats.com after minimizing Elden Ring](https://prnt.sc/uj26-DNh6zJe)\n\n[packetstats.com during offline mode](https://prnt.sc/VdqiHxm-kyhR)\n\nI’ve already ruled out overheating and FPS drops — temps are normal (GPU \\~75°C, CPU \\~85°C).\n\n\n\n# TL;DR\n\nStable ping to Google, but games and latency tests show spikes.

A little café hopping around Jibhi (5 km away) to enjoy cozy vibes and good music. Playing pool or trying momos in best spots (locally recommended)\n\nDay 2 – Peaks, Pines & Campfires \n\nMorning drive towards Shoja and Jalori Pass — the road itself is magical.\nThen we’ll either hike to Serolsar Lake then camp at Raghupur Fort or start late and directly go to fort. Raghupur Fort is famous for its 360⁰ views all around and magical sunset and sunrise!\n\nEvening is all about unwinding back at Mozo (if u didn't called)… bonfire, tree-top dining (Mozo Sky Point) and sipping some local wine (jaggery/Rice/Wheat/Rhodo)\n\nDay 3 – Explore Jibhi Proper.\n\nHead back to Mozo. Take rest and get ready for next adventure.\n\nWe’ll go to my spot for river dipping (just ignore mini thailand it's better), Jibhi Waterfall, and the peaceful Balo Temple (trust me you'll love the forest hike)\n\nWrap up the day with a stroll through Jibhi Market and playibg some games or eating in some cozy places and vibing to music.\n\n\nDay 4 – Riverside Day in Tirthan.\nHead to Tirthan Valley and spend your day by the riverside — dip, relax, or take a short hike to Chhoie Waterfall.\nOn the way back, we’ll stop at a friend’s café — one of the best multi-cuisine spots around.\nThen back to Mozo for another quiet evening.Day 5 – Chill & GoodbyeThis day’s yours — relax, read, paint, play games, or just soak in the mountain calm before you head back home.I’ll personally be your host, local guide, trek companion, and driver during the trip if you need.\nIf you’re into raw, nature-filled days and warm company, you’ll feel right at home here.If you’re curious or planning a trip soon, drop me a message — happy to share more details or help you plan your itinerary better. 🌿🏔️",

I thought that the numbers that are on the wall could be a phone number that might help me narrow it down, but it was from a graffiti artist called **The Plumber King**.  \nI've been trying to compare it with google street view, I've found some alleys that look similar, some even have the same type of car in the background (so it must be a commonly used car). It could be around Ladies Market, but the original picture was uploaded in 2018, so the alley could've changed.  \n  \nCould anyone recognise which district or street this is? Any help is much appreciated!\n\nThanks!",

I am actually into homesteading. So I would comment , ask about random things homestead related.  I wondered about the chickens recently, or lackthereof.  I had commented something and never even checked again until the other day to see if she'd updated about the chickens or homestead progress.  \n\nAnd I found I was blocked.  I was like WTF, I only saw random posts and wasn't even a \"fan\" really.  I remembered she'd posted about stalkers once before and I asked her why she didn't just make her page private (uhh...duh).  No comment.  SO.  After I'm blocked, I'm 100 times more curious.  So I google.  This page comes up and then I make a reddit account.  And now I'm invested 100 times more than I ever was in the LLR/JJR days lol.  what a twatwaffle!!  Pam - if you're reading.  You do more damage than you realize with the blocking.

    "content": "My boyfriend told me he plans to go drinking tomorrow night and then drive home. I pushed back, saying he needs to get and use a breathalyzer before deciding to drive. He dismissed my concerns and said I was “digging in,” like I’ve been unreasonable about this in the past.\n\nI told him to google “partner drinks and then drives” and then tell me again I’m being unreasonable. Then I hung up on him.\n\nThis isn’t coming out of nowhere. Months ago, we were at a friend’s house and both had too much to drink. Our friend and I had to work hard to stop him from driving, we got the keys and ended up Ubering. Another time, he did drive us home after drinking, and while I regret not stopping him, I still think it was risky. Not “fall-down drunk,” but clearly not sober.\n\nHe’s a big, muscular guy and doesn’t binge, so he probably wasn’t over the legal limit, but that doesn’t mean he was safe to drive. In some states, even being under the limit can still get you a DUI based on behavior or judgment.\n\nI feel like asking him to use a breathalyzer is a fair and simple way to take guesswork out of it. Personally, I’d prefer he just Uber or use a designated driver, but he lives in another state and I’m not there yet to help manage this.\n\nTo me, drinking and driving is just not worth the risk, to himself or others. It's rapidly becoming a red line, AIO for drawing a hard line here? ",

Does anyone have any fitness programs they could recommend for some gentle toning, especially around the upper body? I’ve checked the wiki and it seems like most routines have the goal of getting rid of natural feminine features, which I think would give me dysphoria. Attached is a link of some exercises I was running: nothing rigid, just a couple of things every couple of days. https://docs.google.com/document/d/15G5k0ozLYzlG2PI1OeC0DdSQT6uiE3J1VC7UGHT-maQ/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\nTLDR: Nonbinary AFAB not on T wants a routine that is lightly masculinizing, but doesn’t completely take away feminine features!

    "content": "Eligibility\nIn order for the referring Chime member (“Referrer”) to qualify and receive the $100.00 monetary referral reward and $10.00 temporary SpotMe Bonus, and for the referred person (“Referred”) to qualify and receive the $100.00 referral reward, all of the following conditions must be satisfied: (1) Referrer meets SpotMe eligibility requirements and is part of the SpotMe Referral Incentive campaign to receive the SpotMe Bonus; (2) Referred has not previously opened a Chime Checking Account (“Account”); (3) Referred opens a new Account between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2025; (4) Referred opens the new Account using the Referrer’s unique referral link; (5) Referred receives in the new Account a Qualifying Direct Deposit within 45 calendar days of opening the Account; and (6) Referred activates one of their physical Chime Visa Cards within 14 days of receiving a Qualifying Direct Deposit. A Qualifying Direct Deposit is a deposit of $200.00 or more by Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) that comes from your employer, payroll provider, gig economy payer, or benefits payer OR a deposit by Original Credit Transaction (OCT) from your gig economy payer. Bank ACH transfers, Pay Anyone transfers, verification or trial deposits from financial institutions, peer to peer transfers from services such as PayPal, Cash App, or Venmo, mobile check deposits, cash deposits, one-time direct deposits, such as tax refunds and other similar transactions, and any deposit that Chime deems to not be legitimate are not Qualifying Direct Deposits.\nReward Timing\nReferral rewards will generally be provided within two (2) business days after all the above conditions are met. The Referrer’s account must be in good standing in order to receive the referral reward. Any Referrer SpotMe Bonus under this promotion will expire 184 calendar days after the SpotMe Bonus is issued to the Referrer.\nLimitations\nMembers will not be enrolled in SpotMe automatically. Referrer members must qualify for SpotMe and enroll manually through the Chime App in order to receive the temporary SpotMe Bonus. No more than $50.00 in SpotMe Bonuses may be added to a member’s SpotMe limit at one time. If the Referrer has reached this $50.00 SpotMe Bonus maximum, any other earned SpotMe Bonuses will be added to the Referrer’s bonus queue (“Bonus Queue”). Any earned SpotMe Bonus from this promotion in the member’s Bonus Queue not yet added to the member’s SpotMe limit (due to the promotional limit cap) will be added to the member’s SpotMe limit on a rolling basis as the previously added SpotMe Bonuses to the member’s SpotMe limit expire. Members may earn referral rewards for up to ten(“10”) successful referrals per calendar year (January 1, 2025 – December 31, 2025). No member’s SpotMe limit may exceed $270.00, across their base limit, bonuses and boosts. If an eligible Referrer loses SpotMe eligibility, and the Referred completes the above conditions, the Referrer will receive the $10.00 temporary SpotMe Bonus only upon regaining SpotMe eligibility. You may not register a domain name using “Chime” for sharing your referral link (e.g. Chimereferral[.]com). Generally, if you send your referral link to a Referred, you represent that you have the necessary consent from the Referred to send them any text or email relating to this offer. Please note that Washington State law places specific restrictions on the sending of commercial\ntext messages to a recipient who resides in the State of Washington. If you plan to send your referral link via text message to a resident of the State of Washington, you must obtain the consent of that recipient prior to sending them your Chime referral link via text message. You should maintain a record of that consent. Referred individuals acknowledge that payment of any referral reward may result in the Referrer’s knowledge of the Referred’s establishment of a new Account or enrollment in a product. Chime reserves the right to cancel or modify the terms of any referral promotion or terminate a member’s eligibility at any time with or without prior notice.\nTaxes and Further Disclosures\nCredits of $10.00 or more will be reported on tax form 1099-INT for new members (Referred). If a Chime member receives certain monetary rewards that total $600.00 or more in one calendar year, this will be reported on tax form 1099-MISC as required for the Chime member.

    "content": "\\- According to the expert, neoclouds are preferred for AI workloads because their infrastructure is purpose-built for high-performance computing. Unlike hyperscalers, which rely on legacy network designs optimized for general cloud use, neoclouds feature low-latency, high-bandwidth networks, often using InfiniBand, tailored specifically for GPU-intensive AI tasks. Neoclouds offer a more efficient and specialized environment for AI, making them increasingly attractive to both [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click) and enterprise customers.  \n  \n\\- The expert explains that while, hyperscalers provide valuable high-level AI services, they can create vendor lock-in. [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click)'s acquisition of Lepton and the rebranding of DGX Cloud to DGX Cloud Lepton enables customers to manage and unify AI workloads across multiple environments, whether in [$CRWV](https://x.com/search?q=%24CRWV&src=cashtag_click), [$AMZN](https://x.com/search?q=%24AMZN&src=cashtag_click), or [$MSFT](https://x.com/search?q=%24MSFT&src=cashtag_click), giving users more control and mobility, much to the frustration of traditional cloud providers.  \n  \n\\- The expert explains that [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click)'s strategy to buy compute back from neoclouds after selling them chips is not just about keeping its balance sheet capital-light, it's also about focusing its resources on core competencies like chip design and testing. Managing physical data centers involves significant overhead, including staffing, power, cooling, and maintenance, which [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click) prefers to avoid. The expert adds that [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click) partners with multiple neoclouds, such as [$CRWV](https://x.com/search?q=%24CRWV&src=cashtag_click) and [$NBIS](https://x.com/search?q=%24NBIS&src=cashtag_click) not only to diversify risk but also because no single provider is currently large enough to meet all of [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click)'s internal compute needs.  \n  \n\\- The expert underscores CUDA's unmatched role in GPU programming, highlighting not only its broad compatibility across past, present, and future [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click) GPUs, but also its unique ability to improve performance on older hardware over time. Unlike typical software that slows down older devices, CUDA updates actually optimize legacy GPUs, making them faster with each release. This backward-compatible and forward-enhancing design allows developers to benefit from new CUDA features without rewriting code, even as GPU architectures evolve.",

    "content": "Hey fellow owners — like many of you, I’ve got a Terrashroom unit that’s now totally useless since the app and cloud backend went offline. I’ve been looking for a way to make it work again, even without coding skills, and asked ChatGPT for help.\n\nIt gave me this full walkthrough that claims you can reflash the board using ESPHome or Tasmota with zero coding required — just a cheap USB-TTL adapter and a browser.\n\nBut here’s the thing:\n\n> ⚠️ I have not done this yet. I don’t know if it actually works.\nI’m posting to see if anyone more experienced can confirm if this is real or AI hallucination before I go and buy parts or risk frying my board.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n🧩 What ChatGPT Says Is Possible:\n\nThe brain of the unit is likely an ESP32, which can be reflashed\n\nYou can connect using a USB to TTL adapter via the RX/TX pins\n\nThen flash ESPHome or Tasmota using your browser (no code, no soldering)\n\nThat would supposedly let you control:\n\n✅ Heater\n\n✅ Fan\n\n✅ Humidifier\n\n✅ Lights\n\n✅ Read sensors (temp, humidity)\n\n\nAll without the original app or cloud\n\n\n\n---\n\n🪛 The “No Code” Steps It Gave Me:\n\n1. Open the unit\nFind the main board (ESP32), locate pins like TX/RX/GND/3.3V\n\n\n2. Use a USB to TTL adapter\n\nTX → RX\n\nRX → TX\n\nGND → GND\n\n3.3V → 3.3V (Not 5V!)\nThen plug it into your laptop\n\n\n\n3. Flash with ESPHome or Tasmota\n\nhttps://web.esphome.io\n\nor https://tasmota.github.io/install\nThese let you install basic firmware and connect to WiFi\nYou get a web UI to toggle outputs and create automations\n\n\n\n4. Use it like a grow controller again\n\nAutomate humidity/temp control\n\nSchedule lights/fans\n\nAll local, app-free\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n❓My Question for You All:\n\nHas anyone here actually reflashed their unit this way?\n\nCan the ESP32 be accessed via TTL?\n\nAre the pinouts exposed on all versions?\n\nWill this work to control the key components (heater, humidifier, etc)?\n\nIs there a known pin map or working ESPHome config?\n\n\nI’m not trying to spread false hope — just trying to see if this approach is real before I go down the rabbit hole. If it is, I’ll document every step for the rest of us.\n\nAppreciate any insight — even a “nah, that won’t work” is helpful at this point.\n\nPS. I ended up swapping out the original Terrashroom sensors with an HDC1080 temperature and humidity module. It’s a low power, high-precision digital sensor that worked perfectly once I reflashed. For anyone else who wants to try this, here’s the exact 2-pack I used on Amazon: https://amzn.to/472nY5h\n\n🙏 Thanks!",

    "content": "🌿 **Detailed Overview:**\n\nServes as a spiritual and psychological reminder that human thought is a creative force shaping personal destiny. Written in his distinctive conversational and uplifting tone, Dooley structures the book as a series of short reflections drawn from his *Notes from the Universe* teachings. The central message is that thoughts, when focused through belief and emotion, become the blueprint for material and emotional reality. He blends metaphysical principles with practical encouragement, showing how confidence in the Universe transforms possibility into experience. The work guides readers to become conscious architects of their own lives by aligning inner intention with outer action. Its unique value lies in its accessible articulation of the law of attraction—infused with warmth, humor, and a grounded sense of empowerment.\n\n🔍 **Key Themes and Insights:**\n\n* **The Creative Power of Thought:** Every idea held with emotion carries the potential to manifest in reality. Dooley teaches that awareness of one’s mental patterns is the first step toward conscious creation. By disciplining thought, individuals reclaim authorship over their lives.\n* **Confidence in the Universe:** The Universe is depicted as an intelligent, benevolent force that responds to faith and clarity. Trusting this partnership dispels fear and hesitation. Confidence becomes the spiritual magnet for opportunity and synchronicity.\n* **Focus and Alignment:** Scattered thoughts weaken manifestation, while clear focus strengthens it. Concentrating on one desired outcome organizes both mind and environment toward fulfillment. This principle transforms dreaming into intentional creation.\n* **Positive Expectation:** Expecting good outcomes amplifies energy and draws matching experiences. Dooley urges readers to shift from doubt to delight, knowing that joy accelerates results.

    "content": "🌿 **Detailed Overview:**\n\nMike Dooley continues his trilogy with a renewed focus on co-creation, joy, and alignment with the Universe. Written in a playful yet profound tone, the book offers daily reflections meant to inspire faith in the creative process and delight in the unfolding of life. It builds on the premise that the Universe is not a distant force but a conscious partner responding to our thoughts and emotions. The structure follows Dooley’s signature format—short, poetic notes that deliver bursts of spiritual insight and humor. Core teachings highlight gratitude, relaxation, and trust as essential tools for manifesting desired outcomes. Its unique value lies in transforming complex metaphysical ideas into accessible, uplifting guidance that merges spirituality with everyday living.\n\n🔍 **Key Themes and Insights:**\n\n* **Co-Creation with the Universe:** The book presents the Universe as a responsive ally in manifesting one’s dreams. It invites readers to treat life as a dance rather than a struggle. This cooperative approach emphasizes harmony between human intention and divine orchestration.\n* **Joyful Manifestation:** Dooley stresses that joy and gratitude accelerate the manifestation process. Focusing on positive emotions rather than obstacles draws fulfilling outcomes closer. This principle redefines goal-setting as a celebration of possibility.\n* **Trusting the Process:** Readers are encouraged to release control and trust the timing of life’s unfolding. Patience and faith replace anxiety and force. This trust allows miracles to emerge naturally through unseen alignment.\n* **Creative Action:** Manifestation requires not only belief but movement in the physical world. Each action, no matter how small, signals readiness to receive. Through motion, thought transforms into tangible reality.\n* **Living in Rhythm:** Life is portrayed as a dance in which every step, whether graceful or awkward, contributes to mastery. Staying attuned to one’s inner rhythm keeps alignment with universal flow. This harmony nurtures both peace and creative spontaneity.\n\n🕊️ **Audience Takeaway:**\n\nReaders gain a deeper sense of partnership with the Universe and their own creative power. The book teaches that surrender, gratitude, and joyful participation replace effortful striving. Through relaxed awareness, life becomes a dance guided by intuition and trust. It ultimately reminds readers that every step taken in faith choreographs a more radiant future.\n\n💌 **Your Experiences and Reflections:**\n\nReading this book may inspire a shift from control to collaboration with the unseen forces guiding your path. Each day’s reflection becomes a gentle invitation to relax into the rhythm of life. Practicing gratitude and trust reveals how effortlessly things align when resistance dissolves. How can I learn to hear the “music” of my life more clearly? What might change if I approached challenges as steps in a greater dance?\n\n*  [Kindle](https://amzn.to/46ZEfYv)\n* [Audio CD](https://amzn.to/47iqENl)\n* [Audiobook](https://amzn.to/4725jXh)\n* [Amazon Hardcover](https://amzn.to/4nG1fTB)",

Technically, we’re coiling above a reclaimed level; these patterns often resolve within a few sessions once volume returns.\n\n\n\nMy expectation: a controlled pop to $1.70-$1.75 as sentiment normalizes and more traders process the feasibility details.

NASDAQ: MYNZ just showed pancreatic accuracy that stands out for a blood-based screen and mapped a credible scale path (larger retrospective → PCR validation). That invites attention from new eyes who were skeptical yesterday.\n\n\n\nWithin days, I’m looking for a move toward $1.70–$1.75 as awareness rises and the order book thins. If $1.75 flips to support, the path to $2.00 is a staircase, not a leap.

Add the Q4 eAArly DETECT 2 catalyst and you have a time-boxed reason for attention to rotate back soon. Slow day ≠ weak thesis - it’s often the best entry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nGLTO JZXN EDHL FOFO AEI SPHL TDDT NEE GWAV ORCL HD AVTX CLRB HIMS MSN PWM PC AVGO INBS PUBM DDC UBER SPRB FLUT ISPC CLIK APVO SFHG AMBI NISN VRT LBGJ TELO NERV NOW T AREC HIT ASNS STRO CHR THH POET IQST PALI BA PANW V AREB EPSM PMEC HKPD UAMY NXXT MIGI OKLO LPTX HOWL WDC RVPH FBLG CFLT SLGL NXL DELL WMT QTTB OPEN NFLX SNOW FIG SHMD FPAY RITR TNMG NAOV GILD TOVX CRWD LXEO ANET MGIH COST GORV DLXY BRN AEHR IPSC UNH RNTX CISS TJX KLAC BIAF SLMT GEV COIN HOOD CSCO LCFY ELPW CAT INDP INTU MA CRM META QS IBM MSPR CCHH CRVO BRLT SNWV DRMA PM DVLT MARA TMO LINK BENF LYRA UPC GS COCH ICE CLYM DRCT DHI BAOS RKLB TCRT PLTR BCG VELO GPUS DEVS BKSY BQ LLY BJDX HCWB SHFS PCSA POLA WETH EDSA BKNG SDOT ATON F IREN NBIS TSLA ASTS PFE QUBT OKUR",

    "content": "Today’s tape is sleepy, spreads are wide, and volume is light - exactly when patient bids get filled at a discount. NASDAQ: MYNZ has already reclaimed the $1.60 pivot on the 15-min and is basing above VWAP. That gives a tight risk marker with upside back toward the $1.70–$1.75 shelf if buyers reappear.\n\n\n\nNear-term reasons this can push higher within days: \n\n(1) fresh pancreatic feasibility hit 100% sensitivity / 95% specificity with precancer detection - momentum stories often see “second-day” interest as more traders read the PR; \n\n(2) Europe remains a drip-feed of adoption updates (U.K. authorization, Swiss launch, Germany payer channel), any of which can spark a pop; \n\n(3) Q4 CRC topline still on the calendar, pulling attention forward. On a slow day, discounted fills plus a visible catalyst path is a favorable combo for swing entries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOVX NBIS BURU PFE CLYM GWAV MU LBGJ UAMY SLGL BNAI SES BAOS BIAF BA VYNE AREC BJDX NAOV BGL SOPA FPAY FLUT IPSC T UNH LPTX SNWV OKUR HOWL SPRB MARA BQ ISPC AVGO PANW BKSY CRML V BTM HUMA SPHL SKYE ELPW IREN DHI CCHH DEVS HD PUBM CISS THH HIMS QUBT EDHL IQST MSPR TSLA AEHR COST PMEC WETH OPEN RGC JZXN AMBI WMT ICE AVTX PCSA VIVK BMNR ANIX META PC PL CRDO COIN PWM LLY CLIK MTEN HIT HCWB RNAZ RKLB ANET CRCL KLAC NFLX GEV FIG AMLX TELO YYAI EGAN VELO TCRT GLBZ AEI RVSN NITO DLXY BRN ELAB BCG RNTX EDSA NOW",

Today’s sleepy tape - wide spreads, low volume - is perfect for patient bids grabbing cheap fills.\n\nWhy it could pop soon: \n\n(1) PancAlert’s 100% sensitivity/95% specificity with precancer detection is fresh, likely drawing second-day buzz; \n\n(2) EU ColoAlert updates (U.K., Switzerland, Germany payers) could spark a spike; \n\n(3) Q4 2025 CRC data sets a 2026 pivotal.

And we can’t – America cannot currently manufacture its own drones.”\n\nMorgan Stanley said that if Tesla captures even a fraction of the future eVTOL market, the impact on its valuation could be significant. \n\n“We’re coming up with potential preliminary outcomes in the order of $100 per Tesla share on the low-end to approximately $1,000 per Tesla share (or more) on the high end,” wrote the bank.  \n",

This EP did relatively well when launched, as we were the main indie rock act in our small town (1 mi inhabitants) around 2018-19. After this relase, we played a few gigs but were most of the time inactive and averaging around 150-200 monthly listeners for the last couple of years.\n\nWhat we did and the investment (converting BRL to USD):\n\n- PR: 714 USD. Got exposure on Rolling Stone Brazil, Billboard Brazil, the main websites in our niche, 3 out of 5 of the biggest IG accounts in our niche, and 2 curators also on IG.\n- Meta Ads (Conversion Campaigns): 300 USD. Cost per result is at 0,74 USD generating around 405 listeners.\n- Showcase Campaign for the Single: 178 USD. Cost per listener was 0,80 USD. Generated 222 listeners.\n- Organic Promo on IG + X (the only social media we have).\n\nI have some questions:\n\n1 - What would you do if you were at the same situation? Our goal is to keep growing our audience and to be able to make shows again in our hometown + nearby cities and eventually being able to play at bigger cities like Sāo Paulo and Rio.\n2 - Should I choose Meta Ads or Showcase on Spotify? Keep both?\n3 - Should I start on tiktok or go all gas no brakes on IG?\n4 - When should I be releasing new music? What would be the best timing?\n\nTy!",

    "content": "Hello everyone, I wanted to make a quick recap of my climb to MasterBall this season.\n\n\n\nWhenever I play Ranked, what I hate the most is not being able to play my game (aka bricking) or over-relying on a specific card for some common matchups. I tried some options, including old favorites and new players in the meta. For example, I used Arceus Daycare last meta and while it's pretty nice, it's really tough into Oricorio, which you face quite often so that's pretty annoying. I tried the new grass decks and Decidueye having no draw power + reliance on Rare Candy to get going meant you completely brick sometimes.\n\n\n\nEventually, I decided to try my own spin on a good ol' Silvally-Rampardos list. My idea was to use two Reds and Rocky Helmet to make sure you can OHKO everything standing in your way (with some slight exceptions).\n\n\n\nWhat I like about this deck is that you always start with your ideal Pokemon. It's pretty straight-forward and doesn't get blocked by Oricorio. It also feels pretty good in the meta right now. I mostly faced Suicune and Electric decks on the way to MB. Electric is heavily favored unless you draw very poorly. Suicune didn't feel bad to face but you have to actively think about how to use your Type:Null and when to bench things in the early game. All other gameplans are straightforward.\n\n\n\nI had a +-75% win rate from UB3 to MB.\n\n\n\nSome notes about my list and my games:\n\n\n\n\\- Type:Null is actually super clutch, you don't always want to evolve your first one. It's sometimes nice to just attack with a Null while you power up a back up on the bench. 20 ping into Silvally + Red (120) can kill most uncapped EXs for example. 20 ping + Rampardos / Red combo also kills almost everything. There were games won off a Red+Null attack after Silvally weakened an EX too.\n\n\n\n\\- 2x Red was the whole reason I wanted to try this deck. Rampardos gets OHKOs very often with them. For the few Pokemons sitting above 150HPs, you will be trying to ping them with Null or have Rocky Helmet set up the kill for Ramp.\n\n\n\n\\- 0 Cyrus, I almost never regretted not having it. This deck really aims at getting OHKOs so you're barely ever trying to kill something that is sitting on the bench. The main exception were games where I would have liked to finish off a baby because Null only did 20.\n\n\n\n\\- The main cards I often wish I had were: Giovanni / Pokemon Communication / Cyrus. Giovanni sets up OHKOs vs Babies with Null and also give a 140 swing with Rampardos for OHKO vs Darkrai/Suicune. Pokemon Communication would have been nice to trade a Silvally for a Ramp in some cases. Cyrus for obvious reasons. If you wanna try them, I'd recommend slotting them over Iono (although Iono was the closest card I could use that was \"draw power\" to get out of clunky hands/give myself a shot at getting Rampardos going) or maybe even using 2 Gio over 2 Red.\n\n\n\n\\- In some cases, I kinda wanted Mars to be a Red Card so I could disrupt hand + supporter at the same time, but Mars also powers up Silvally and is stronger in the mid game. Regardless, you really need at least one hand disruption card in this meta otherwise too many decks have too many options at their disposal.\n\n\n\n\\- Don't forget that if you're KOing yourself with Rampardos and you have nothing on the bench, you will lose and not tie (unless your opponent has no benched Pokemon either). This actually comes up more than you'd think.\n\n\n\nI know it's a long text for a simple deck but I wanted to share my experience and I think it could be helpful if you want something consistent for your MB climb!",

    "content": "Even if HSR is a single player game so who is broken and who isnt only matter as long as you can clear content, which tbf units from 3.0 til now hasnt gotten much issue clearing 3 main end game contents(MoC,PF,AS). Despite Cas being one of the only viable comp for AA, it being a \"whale only\" mode still make it acceptable.\n\nBut i genuinely question whats the thought process of Hoyo in creating and designing Cas. \n\n1st is balance trade offs. Every characters has to be strong in 1 aspect at the trade off in other. For example playing sustainless gives you extremely high damage ceiling but the fragility of a paper. For HP scalers, who are by design significantly tankier than regular atk scaling dps and so to limit their ceiling, making HP scalers requires a healer is actually a great move from Hoyo, Mydei is a clear example (while yes he can play sustainless but the difference is marginal).\n\nWhich is why i want to ask, on what green Earth was in Hoyo's mind designing a team comp that have 4 times the effective HP of a regular atk scaling team comp (HP scalers have twice and then their memosprite too) while still having the highest damage output in every team comp in the game. Even before Evernight that pushes Cas to be the definitive best dps in the game, Cas with just Hyacine was the best dps in the game which Phainon being a close 2nd. So even without shilling teammates and contents, Cas as an HP scaler was already the tankiest team comp with the highest damage output. Which again begs the question \"whats the trade off\".\n\n2nd Abnormally Arbitration, damage inflation and a requirement of sustain. HSR for about 2 years of it release has been design as a damage rush type of game, it doesnt matter you are on 1 HP if the enemy hits 0 first, which is why sustainless has been very popular to a lot of people. But in recent times, not just HP inflation but enemies also has their damage output inflated, enemies been slowly having an increase in damage modifiers, along side having a \"nuke\" that deletes team comps which make sustains a requirement to clear end game. And guess whose ceiling is not affected by running sustains. \n\nBack in 3.2, on Cas initial releases, her damage output was on par with sustainless dps but because she requires a healer so it wasnt as bad. One can choose to play sustainless for a higher damage output or play Cas for comfortability. But now,like mentioned above, because enemies starts to hit harder, sustainless is hardly an option to consider anymore(even for Phainon). And because the only advantage atk scaling dps has over HP scaling dps is gone, Cas higher scaling to offset requirements of a healer is now what rockets her to be miles ahead of other dps\n\nAnd this was in context of people complaining about powercreep around 3.0 even. Like yea, team comp were dealing ~7m dmg is way too much powercreep, how about we push that to 25m on a comp with sustain. Like good job Hoyo, you made Riot's game balacing team look competent\n\nHow to fix this? Well the short answer is you cant without completely powercreep Cas out of the meta along side with everything up until 4.0. And heading to 4.x, while we'll probably shift to a new meta with new niches (like idk, Eff Res scaling dps or smthg), HP scalers(Cas) will get less update, but at the current state, the fact that they have competent damage output while still being tanky as hell will means to push newer releases, Hoyo would need to make bosses even more tailored made. Like imagine we get 3-4 Pollux in a row for different dps releases.\n\nBut assuming Cas is somehow powercrept out of the meta(at the cost of everything until 4.0), how to prevent these type of situation to not happen again if for some reason HP scalers are back into the meta or Hoyo make Def scaling dps? Well you can incorporate semi survivability into atk scaling dps/atk scaling supports, like Anaxa for example, his \"Sublimation\" can cut inbetween enemies extra turns,cutting their action and thus damage by half or Hysilens atk reduction, as a result putting less strain on sustaining; a team with like 2-3 semi survivability skill will allows atk scaling dps to be able to play more aggressive(sustainless) to keep the balance of \"damage output\"-\"survivability\". Allow sustainless runs at a risk for higher damage output or comfortability for lower damage output.\n\nHere's tldr:\n\nHP scalers have no trade off between survivability and damage output and thus as the game evolves to force the requirement for a sustain, atk scaling dps falls behind as sustainless is no longer an option and this horrendous state of game balance is demonstrated by Cas as a team, having 4 times as much effective HP while having a damage output of a sustainless team comp",

Coupled this with all of the perks that help you reload, such as ground pounder, fast fighter (both in perception), Gun tricks (ghoul, agility), and wild West hands (ghoul, Luck).\n\nThe damage is insane. Stack reverse onslaught cards for 21 stacks (mostly for weak spot and faster reload per stack since I’m not running furious).\n\nUsing crits in luck (Better Criticals, Critical Savvy, Luck of the Draw), more for the guaranteed hits than the crit, but believe me the damage goes through the roof.\n\nMost of the time I just aim through the sites and fire if they’re too far for VATs since I’m not stacking a lot of vats perks like awareness or eye of the hunter. Can use crits to help for the guaranteed longshot.\n\nRunning the normal stuff like easy target and scattershot in strength, running tormentor and number cruncher in agility of course. Gunsmith and demolition expert in Int. Also I do run radiation power in endurance.\n\nEscape artist, though I don’t rely on sneak attacks. It’s still just pushes it even higher when you can get it. I usually put two points in enforcer to give it the extra 50% crippling effects. \n\nMutations are pretty typical, such as adrenal and eagle eyes.\n\nWeapons: Quad/explosive - pistol, rifle, and dragon. Pistol reloads really fast and is good for running through indoors. Rifle reloads faster than quad dragon and can use the dragon on bosses.\n\nEverything is one shot except nuke bosses and raid bosses. By the odd chance that something survives, it’s so crippled that it might as well be dead.\n\nMost of the weapons show based damage of around 2000+\n\nI do carry some other weapons, a furious broadsider for some events and a twoshot explosive cranked Gatling so that I can spread some fire and tag things. Mostly, I do this so that I’m not one shotting everything at events. \n\nIt’s a lot of fun! Worth giving it a try.",

Unlike standard LLMs trained as helpful assistants, this one is specialized to mimic human users—generating realistic queries, follow-ups, and even conversation endings based on a given \"task intent.\" \n\nTrained on a filtered WildChat-1M dataset using four NVIDIA A6000 GPUs, it excels in distributional alignment (lower perplexity on user test data) and intrinsic metrics like maintaining conversation flow and sharing info across turns. It's ideal for researchers testing assistant LLMs in simulated dialogues, revealing performance gaps that scripted prompts miss—such as in math or coding tasks.\n\nFor hands-on exploration, load it via Hugging Face Transformers with custom guardrails to avoid repetition or early stops. A forthcoming arXiv paper details the full methodology. This could revolutionize user modeling and synthetic data generation in AI development.",

I have already bought some stocks and honestly am really confused. We are given a starting amount of $100,000. We have invested 30 shares into advance micro devices (AMD) for $232.92, 40 shares into NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG) for $168.76, NVIDIA CORP (NVDA) for $193.91, as well as 10 shares on coke for $122.70. As of right now we have a total equity of $100,047.93. Some more details to share are we can only trade stocks and mutual funds listed on the NASDAQ stock market and the New York Stock Exchange. No over-the-counter, “pink sheet”, or penny stocks. We dint have to liquidate our portfolios at the end, we will be graded determined on either total equity or percent return above/below S&P 500 growth. When buying you must do a minimum of 10 shares. The system is ran 9:30am-4pm, stock trades entered after closing of market or on weekends will be priced at the next day’s opening price. I have 3-4 months to complete and have to make 50 transactions by then, I want to learn as much as possible as well as increase my total equity.",

    "content": "$NVDA stock recently surged to a record high after the U.S. government approved the company to export advanced AI chips to the United Arab Emirates. This move opens a major new frontier for Nvidia, expanding its reach into one of the fastest-growing technology regions in the world. Investors view the approval as a clear indicator that Nvidia’s global influence continues to strengthen, with the Middle East now emerging as a fresh source of demand for AI infrastructure and innovation.\n\nA key boost came from Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse, who raised his price target for Nvidia from $240 to $300 while maintaining an “Overweight” rating. Muse reinforced that this isn’t a speculative rally—it’s the start of a long and powerful growth cycle fueled by massive investments in AI around the world. He says that the UAE’s appetite for high-performance computing, combined with similar pushes across Asia and Europe, will keep Nvidia’s growth engine running for years. His new target implies more than 20–30% upside, showing confidence that Nvidia’s leadership in AI hardware will continue to translate into record-breaking profits.\n\nHe also expects Nvidia’s profits to soar, projecting earnings of $8 per share in 2026 and $11 by 2027—well ahead of most Wall Street forecasts. Muse believes Nvidia’s end-to-end AI ecosystem and dominance in chip innovation give it a global advantage that few competitors can match.\n\nRegional expansion into markets like the UAE could unlock new layers of revenue and strategic partnerships, extending Nvidia’s growth well beyond the U.S. and China. For the bulls, the latest analyst upgrade isn’t just about price targets—it’s a sign that Nvidia is leading a worldwide technological revolution, and that the story of its rise is still far from over.\n\nAI NVDA ORCL",

    "content": "$NVDA\n\n\n\nNvidia’s stock recently surged to a record high after the U.S. government approved the company to export advanced AI chips to the United Arab Emirates. This move opens up a valuable new market and reinforces Nvidia’s growing influence in global AI infrastructure. Investors reacted with buying, viewing the export approval as another catalyst that could further expand Nvidia’s already dominant position in the industry.\n\nA key reason behind the rally came from Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse, who raised his price target for Nvidia from $240 to $300 while maintaining an “Overweight” rating, meaning he expects the stock to outperform. Muse pushed back against the idea that Nvidia’s rise is a bubble, arguing that the AI sector is still in the early stages of massive long-term growth. His new target implies more than 20–30% upside from current levels, signaling his strong conviction that Nvidia’s earnings and global reach will continue to grow.\n\nMuse’s bullish stance is based on accelerating demand for AI computing across nearly every major industry. He believes Nvidia will remain the central player in this wave, thanks to its end-to-end solutions combining both hardware and software. He also raised his earnings forecasts, expecting Nvidia’s profits to rise to $8 per share in 2026 and $11 by 2027—well ahead of most Wall Street estimates. Nvidia’s leadership in AI chips and its expanding ecosystem make it a unique long-term winner.\n\nNot everyone agrees that the rally is without challenges. Other analysts warn that Nvidia’s valuation is already high and could be challenged by growing competition or trade restrictions. But Muse’s upgraded target reflects confidence that this isn’t a speculative bubble—it’s the start of a historic buildout in AI infrastructure, and Nvidia remains right at the center of it.\n\n  \nNVDA AI ORCL",

I actually asked if they could ring just one up since I could cover that. They did but that was embarrassing.\n\nWent to school got a degree and struggled to make ends meet. Had no comprehension of how money works. Wasted most of it... eventually went for a Bachelors degree and finally just had enough. \n\nPaid off the student loans, focused on health, and maxed out all possible retirement accounts. \n\nI crossed the $100k mark today (85k in VOO and Fxaix, rest is fncmx, vug, and NVDA).

    "content": "\\- According to the expert, neoclouds are preferred for AI workloads because their infrastructure is purpose-built for high-performance computing. Unlike hyperscalers, which rely on legacy network designs optimized for general cloud use, neoclouds feature low-latency, high-bandwidth networks, often using InfiniBand, tailored specifically for GPU-intensive AI tasks. Neoclouds offer a more efficient and specialized environment for AI, making them increasingly attractive to both [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click) and enterprise customers.  \n  \n\\- The expert explains that while, hyperscalers provide valuable high-level AI services, they can create vendor lock-in. [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click)'s acquisition of Lepton and the rebranding of DGX Cloud to DGX Cloud Lepton enables customers to manage and unify AI workloads across multiple environments, whether in [$CRWV](https://x.com/search?q=%24CRWV&src=cashtag_click), [$AMZN](https://x.com/search?q=%24AMZN&src=cashtag_click), or [$MSFT](https://x.com/search?q=%24MSFT&src=cashtag_click), giving users more control and mobility, much to the frustration of traditional cloud providers.  \n  \n\\- The expert explains that [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click)'s strategy to buy compute back from neoclouds after selling them chips is not just about keeping its balance sheet capital-light, it's also about focusing its resources on core competencies like chip design and testing. Managing physical data centers involves significant overhead, including staffing, power, cooling, and maintenance, which [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click) prefers to avoid. The expert adds that [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click) partners with multiple neoclouds, such as [$CRWV](https://x.com/search?q=%24CRWV&src=cashtag_click) and [$NBIS](https://x.com/search?q=%24NBIS&src=cashtag_click) not only to diversify risk but also because no single provider is currently large enough to meet all of [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click)'s internal compute needs.  \n  \n\\- The expert underscores CUDA's unmatched role in GPU programming, highlighting not only its broad compatibility across past, present, and future [$NVDA](https://x.com/search?q=%24NVDA&src=cashtag_click) GPUs, but also its unique ability to improve performance on older hardware over time. Unlike typical software that slows down older devices, CUDA updates actually optimize legacy GPUs, making them faster with each release. This backward-compatible and forward-enhancing design allows developers to benefit from new CUDA features without rewriting code, even as GPU architectures evolve.",

This shit will just snowball until 99% of the internet is just fake news\n* I hate how artists are being completely shafted by AI. \"Let's train AI on all kinds of art and then give credit to absolutely fucking nobody.

MJ, MLK Jr., etc. Absolutely no respect, no boundaries.\n* I hate how no one can fucking think for themselves anymore. What should I watch on TV, let's ask ChatGPT!\n* I hate the amount of money that's pouring into this garbage. Hundreds of billions of dollars of investments going in a circle-jerk between OpenAI, Nvidia, Oracle, AMD. Why the fuck would retail investors or institutions want to invest in anything else when they can put money into NVDA and watch it go up 2% a day\n* I hate the lasting impact to the environment. It's like we're sitting in Vegas fixated on slots and don't care that the casino is on fire.\n* And finally, I hate that I can't see a single benefit of generative AI. What fucking part of life does this slop help with? Environment? Nope. Creativity or intelligence? Nope. Productivity? Not that I've seen, maybe for summarizing emails. Society? Nope.

    "content": "I feel like the AI mania is at its height for now (people were saying it a year ago, but bubbles have a habit of inflating past expectations), so sold out all stocks in NVDA, AMD, TSM today.\n\nNow, I am wondering if I should wait for these companies to deflate in prices in coming months, or put all that money in LAC. I was lucky enough to DCA before the mania in LAC began, with $2.62 average for 2922 shares in LAC. I was thinking of getting a net position in LAC to up till $10,000 (or maybe even more). But feels like the \"big opportunity\" is long behind us, after that first jump last month.\n\nAlthough, I feel like it has to come down at some point. I unfortunately don't have much money to spare, outside of what I got from selling stocks in other companies. And then there's the issue of my broker being a shit broker, so I have to DCA in large amounts, to justify paying their fixed fees per trade, that they introduced recently.\n\nWill the LAC earning's report still have the \"negative\" effect it usually has on the stock price? It seems that now the narratives around LAC have shifted from, \"just another company yet to prove itself\" to a \"diplomatic strategy\". What is the fate of such companies, long-term?",

That rest builds energy, especially when the story just de-risked: pancreatic feasibility at 100%/95% plus precancer detection, and a Q4 readout for the CRC program that feeds a 2026 pivotal.\n\n\n\nWhat turns this quickly: a small volume uptick plus a close above the intraday flag sends screens flashing.

Traders often revisit headlines like this in a few sessions.\n\nBase case: steady climb to $1.70–$1.75 as buzz grows. Stretch case: fast $1.75 reclaim, then $1.95–$2.05.

I am very determined and ready to work my ass off and do what I need to do to get there but I need some assistance paving the right path from those who have a better understanding of how it works.\n\nBackground: I’m a 20year old finance professional, I’ve worked as a retail/commercial banker at top bank(jpm,boa) and currently work at a top wm firm here in nyc. I am pursuing a bachelor’s degree in finance&accounting(non target), graduating next year, and have been working in WM for almost 1 year now. That makes my total YOE in banking/wealth management a little over 2 years. I’m also a registered rep(SIE, series 66, series 7)\n\nMy plan is to get into IB through an analyst program, I’ve seen a few that hired college grads and applied to them. However, my concern is I know how competitive these programs are and want to know if im competitive enough to be considered? Even though I have no IB experience, does my commercial banking and wealth management experience qualify me enough to get me in there? Ofcourse I didn’t apply to any BB, most are lower-tier and low MM banks but my goal is to just get into IB, prove myself and lateral to a BB after about a year or so.\n\nI really need help and insights on your thoughts because that will help me stay realistic. If it is that my chances are extremely slim even with my previous experience, I can at least focus my energy on other more realistic pathways. \n\nAgain, really looking for some helpful and informative comments on this. Thank you all for your assistance!",

    "content": "Listen up, fellow apes. While the penny market is slow and choppy today—full of gap-and-fade traps it's the perfect time to look for names that are de-risking their story.\n\nInstead of chasing today's micro-moves, let's talk about a diagnostics play, Mainz Biomed (MYNZ), that has a clear roadmap of catalysts coming up, making it a solid target to scale into on weakness.\n\nWhy MYNZ is in the \"Setup\" Category\n\nThis company, which is focused on its non-invasive CRC test ColoAlert®, has lined up some huge events over the next six months that could easily drive a re-rate:\n\n1. Major European Expansion: They just got full authorization to market their test, ColoAlert®, in the U.K. (Sept 2, 2025) and are doing a full commercial launch in Switzerland (Sept 23, 2025). That's access to two big, new populations. Look for early revenue updates from these markets.\n2. The Big US Catalyst (Q4 2025): The company is on track to release the crucial top-line data from their eAArly DETECT 2 study by Q4 2025. This data is key because it will set the stage for their massive US pivotal study in 2026. This is the main spec catalyst to watch for.\n3. New Pipeline Validation: Beyond colon cancer, they are also moving forward with a test for pancreatic cancer (PancAlert). The program just got a boost with government funding and is entering feasibility testing. If they confirm the early, highly positive discovery results, it will add a lot of value to the pipeline.\n\nUBER SLMT AMD DHI TNMG TCRT AEI MSTR BAC GSIW ANIX ISPC ELAB HIT GPUS CCHH ABBV QUBT AMZN SES GWAV XOM XBIO BGMS AREC HOWL BMEA SFHG T ZONE CCTG NXXT CFLT ALAB RGTI GLTO LCFY TRUE PMEC BJDX EPWK DVLT SKYE BENF TELO PWM PHOE JPM TRX HUMA BNBX TTD CLIK WMT SMSI META INTU SKYE ARBE UNH MSPR INTC EPSM EDSA PANW FIG UAMY RVSN CRVO FPAY FBLG CCTG YYAI LLY RVPH PLTR ZNB DVLT BQ INDP PL SCWO ZBIO ATON MSN APM WDC GLTO CRM SNGX ELPW PCSA CLYM KLAC NKE IBM VIVK HD SMCI MTEN QCOM NVDA CLIR QTTB CISS DLXY GORV\n\nThe Bottom Line:\n\nIn slow, choppy market conditions like today's, we avoid chasing thin, newsless pumps. We focus on building positions in names that have a clear catalyst roadmap and are actively executing their business plan like MYNZ with its European commercial wins and the upcoming US data readout in Q4.\n\nManage your risk, respect key levels, and let the company's execution drive the move, not daily noise.\n\nWhat other de-risked stocks are you looking at right now?",

    "content": "Hey folks! As you might know, blood sugar regulation is one of the benefits of extended fasting. And I’ve been tracking my blood sugar closely since I tend to get pretty big spikes after meals. So, I measured my glucose response using a continuous glucose monitor (Dexcom G7) to the same foods before a 9-day water fast, then 1 month and 5 months after. (I still need to retest these foods after my recent 10-day water fast.)\n\n🍌 **Bananas (2 bananas)**\n\n* Pre-fast (Dec 2023): **242 mg/dL**\n* Right after fast (Feb 2025): **118 mg/dL**\n* 5 months later (Jul 2025): **187 mg/dL**\n\n🍚 **White Rice (100g)**\n\n* Pre-fast (Mar 2024): **274 mg/dL**\n* 1 month post-fast (Mar 2025): **200 mg/dL**\n* 5 months later (Jul 2025): **207 mg/dL**\n\n🍁 **Maple Syrup (37g, \\~100 cal)**\n\n* Pre-fast (May 2024): **233 mg/dL**\n* 1 month post-fast (Mar 2025): **118 mg/dL**\n* 5 months later (Jul 2025): **163 mg/dL**\n\nAs you see, right after fasting my glucose response improved dramatically. Five months later, some of that benefit faded - but my peaks are still lower than before the fast. Actually, this lines up pretty well with what scientific research says. And just for context: my A1c is 5.3%, so I’m considered metabolically healthy.\n\nI hope this gives a good view of how extended fasting affects blood sugar. If you've done similar tests, it will be interesting to compare notes.",

    "content": "Markets roared back today with a strong rebound across major indexes — the **Nasdaq** surged about **+1.1%**, the **S&P 500** gained **+0.6%**, while the **Dow** held roughly flat. The rally was fuelled by a renewed wave of **AI optimism** and easing rate expectations after recent Fed comments hinted at potential cuts later this year.   \n  \nDespite lingering concerns over a possible government shutdown, investors shrugged off macro worries and piled back into growth and tech.\n\nThe heatmap lit up green, led by semiconductors and big tech. **#AMD** exploded **+11%**, while **#NVDA** climbed **+2.2%** and **#AVGO** added **+2.7%**. **#AAPL** rose modestly at **+0.6%**, **#MSFT** edged slightly higher, **#META** ended in green while **#GOOGL** was the lone big-tech laggard, dipping **–0.5%**. Over in enterprise software, **#ORCL** and **#PLTR** gained on AI-related momentum, and in streaming, **#NFLX** tacked on nearly **+2%**.\n\n**#AMZN** led retail with a **+1.5%** pop, **#TSLA** bounced back **+1.3%**, and defensives like **#JNJ** and **#LLY** stayed steady. Finance was mostly red with **#JPM** **#BAC #WFC** and **#GS** while **#BRK.B** held firm.  \n  \nOverall, it was a risk-on day — traders rotated back into high-growth names as optimism returned to the AI trade.   \n  \nThe question now: is this the start of a new leg higher or just another frothy rally before earnings season kicks in?\n\nMoneyvize makes it easier to spot where strength and weakness are concentrated — whether you’re tracking daily movers or looking for value in recently sold-off names.

    "content": "**Finviz Defined:**\n\nFinviz stands as a stock market analysis platform headquartered in New York, serving both individuals and institutional clients. The company specializes in stock screening, in-depth equity research, and advanced financial visualization tools. Users can swiftly sift through stocks, observe market movers, and receive a comprehensive overview of the financial markets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pros of Finviz Features:**\n\nAccess to 67 unique stock screening metrics\n\nRecognition of 33 distinct chart patterns\n\nReal-time data and 1-minute interval updates with Finviz Elite\n\nRenowned as one of the superior free stock screening utilities\n\nEfficient tracking of market insider transactions and news updates\n\nQuick visualization of sector and industry trends through heatmaps\n\nSeamless integration of news from various sources\n\nComprehensive backtesting capabilities recognizing an array of chart patterns\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cons of Finviz:**\n\nElite backtesting features could offer more versatility\n\nA limited set of 21 chart indicators\n\nAbsence of dedicated mobile applications for both Android and iOS devices\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Functionality Across Devices:**\n\nFinviz operates effortlessly across computers, tablets, and smartphones via web browsers without the need for any software installation. Users, upon signing into Finviz, are welcomed by a dashboard that provides a snapshot of the day's market trends, top-performing stocks, recent news, and significant insider trading actions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Finviz Application Availability:**\n\nCurrently, Finviz does not offer an application for download from either the Android Play Store or the Apple Store. It is advised to access Finviz through conventional web browsers on computers or tablets.\n\n People might mistakenly install the FINWIZ app, but it is not the same company. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Insights into Finviz Heatmaps:**\n\nFinviz's heatmaps offer a dynamic visualization of the US and global stock market performances, pinpointing potential trading opportunities. The platform's ability to compile and display a comprehensive heatmap with such rapidity is noteworthy. Users can gain insights into the latest stock performances, trend lines, and competitor comparisons by simply hovering over stock tickers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0tt7a47r6zb1.jpg?width=1274&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3f3a6517e756611e5e65c828df160e7d087e354\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Market Visualization and Analysis:**\n\nFinviz excels in presenting market data across various filters such as stock price changes, trading volumes, P/E ratios, and more, including analyst recommendations.

While it offers a substantial range of filters, competitors like TradingView, Portfolio123, and Stock Rover provide even more extensive filtering options. Nonetheless, Finviz stands out by allowing screenings based on candlestick and chart patterns, catering to both investors and traders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wcr435x9r6zb1.jpg?width=1273&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e25c16c31a965de1d9cb606aa9cb96c393548914\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Analysis of Finviz Charting:**\n\nFinviz provides essential daily chart pattern recognition and a select number of overlays and indicators, differentiating it from platforms like MetaStock and TradingView. The inclusion of automatic trendline detection and pattern identification offers significant advantages for traders focused on patterns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Enhancements in Finviz Elite Charting:**\n\nThe continuous development of Finviz Elite has resulted in notable improvements to interactive charting, including the addition of Heiken Ashi charts and more indicators and overlays. The new auto-save feature for charts and annotations further enhances the user experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/alyszlpcr6zb1.jpg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d40e73209dbfce747ef92d7ee3b770532132590c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Guide to Building Backtests in Finviz:**\n\nFinviz's backtester is a powerful tool with over 100 indicators, offering automated chart pattern recognition to aid in creating distinctive trading systems. An example of its effectiveness is a system that outperformed the S&P 500 over a 25-year period, utilizing the Price Rate of Change indicator.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tips for Stock Discovery Using Finviz:**\n\nTo identify potential breakout stocks, users can apply specific screener filters like \"Price crossed MA50 above\" and \"Gap Up 5%.\" \n\nFor locating potential short-squeeze candidates, filters like \"Float Short Over 30%\" and \"Option/Short - Optionable\" are useful. \n\nHowever, Finviz does not directly offer tools for finding undervalued stocks; for such a feature, platforms like Stock Rover are recommended, which provide detailed criteria including Fair Value and Margin of Safety for value-seeking investors.",

I now know it’s a not an easy or cheap fix.  (Unless I’m completely misunderstanding what I’m reading). \n\nWhat I’m most curious about is the cost of the parts to repair this thing.  I’m reading that just the hose parts can be 600-700. Labor?  Not much. \n\nThen I search and you can find parts for 1/8 the price.  The difference, of course, are real Honda parts vs after market parts. \n\nIs there any way to save some money here?  \n\n",

The price was hitting small roadblocks, but quickly breaking past them, with lots of people ready to buy the dips. This tells us the move has momentum, not that it's about to stop.\n\nWhat used to be a tough price to pass is now becoming the new lowest point. The trading data suggests new money is coming into the stock, not just long-time investors selling all their shares.\n\nWhy the sudden interest? The company has been doing well:\n\n* Their revenue shot up overcompared to last year.\n* They are growing their business (expanding routes and fuel stations).\n* They have new contracts for healthcare power systems that promise steady income.\n* They have a big campus in Florida ready for more growth.\n* The company is spending less money (saving aboutmillion a month).\n* Insiders (people who work there) are buying the stock.\n\nSo, here's the game plan for today:\n\n* If the price dips early, it should stay aboveto.\n* The next big price goal is , and if it clears that, it might run up to or.\n* If the stock closes below forminutes, it might drop back to before buyers step in again.\n\nAre you planning to buy on the way up, or wait for that lower price area to reload?\n\n  \nBJDX ANET HD HUMA SOFI BMEA PHOE MSTR BNBX SRPT EGAN AKAN JNJ TNMG FLUT PYPL YYAI UNH THH GPUS PRHI ZBIO BGL SGLY LBGJ WMT GWAV PWM MSN ZONE AGRZ BENF XBIO QNCX POET ABBV PG EPWK JPM VELO EDHL AMZN TSLA AUST CLIK BGMS RNAZ UPC MSGY MGIH HCWB MSPR SKYE SMTK WBX CCTG LRCX TJX APP REKR DRCT SDOT NFLX ADBE SNOW NISN SFHG COIN BKSY VRT AEI OKUR PMAX CCHH XOM INDP ANIX NOW HIMS CLRB APM SHOP SCWO ELAB TRUE BURU ",

We are downgrading FedEx (FDX) to Neutral following recent channel checks across the less-than-truckload (LTL) industry, which suggest a lower valuation multiple is warranted for the Freight segment in our sum-of-the-parts (SoTP) analysis.\n* KTOS - B Riley downgrades to neutral form Buy, raises PT to 105 rom 72. We are increasing our Kratos price target from $72 to $105 but are downgrading the stock from Buy to Neutral as we believe valuation is becoming stretched. This is less about the probable net present value of future free cash flow and more tied to escalating multiples among high-flying defense technology peers, both public and private.\n*  ABB TO SELL ROBOTICS UNIT TO SOFTBANK FOR ENT.

Utilities and defensive names held up better, in many cases showing green or flat.\n\nSo what led to choppy markets today?   \nFirst, a report raising questions about the margins in AI infrastructure (especially around Oracle) rattled tech sentiment.[ ](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/stocks-fall-after-report-raises-concerns-about-ai-profitability-f7d5c027?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  \n  \nThen there’s the looming U.S. government shutdown eating into confidence and blowing up the release schedule for key data (jobs, inflation).[ ](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-1-2025-10-07/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  \n  \nGold meanwhile spiked past $4,000/oz on safe-haven flows and with the Fed on the sidelines (or even leaning dovish), investors are jittery about what happens next in rates and earnings.[ ](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/easy-fed-risks-pouring-fuel-everything-rally-2025-10-07/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  \n  \nSo today’s takeaway: rotation, caution, and questions galore.

    "content": "Hi all!\n\nI am post-bac with my neuroscience degree from a small liberal arts school, and I want to do neurobiology research in academia. Obviously, not great timing, but I am (maybe stubborny) not interested in industry or alternative science routes. I am super passionate not only about neuroscience, but academia in general. \n\nFor some context, I am also financially very well situated which I am so unimaginebly grateful and aware of the privledge that brings me. I am saying this so its clear the freedom lack of barriers I face in that sense to pursuing higher education or working in academia. I also have no desire for a family or spouse, it is just going to be me and my dog against the world and that also brings a certain freedom. \n\nOddly enough I am also a first gen college student and first gen-career pursuer (as in no adult in my family/close to me has ever had to experience the pain and suffering of writing cover letters and networking), I am a bit lost and feel lacking a lot of information and orientation to this environment. \n\n  \nI guess my goal initially was to become a PI, but honestly I am thinking  I may enjoy and my skills may be better utilized as more of a high level staff scientist in a larger lab. Not sure exactly what that looks like, but I see many labs have research associates or coordinators or managers and such that are PhD holders. I think I would make a badass side kick, but I will have to get a better feel for what seems right as I get into that kind of environment. liberal arts schools are definitly their own little bubble. I want my PhD regardless, not just as the means to an end but I want the experience and journey and ability to dive into something at such a high level and so intensely.\n\nThat being said, there is a part of me that maybe wants to become a liberal arts professor myself, or at least try ik thats an incredibly hard route (as is all routes I guess in academia). Not sure how to parse through if that is a genuine interest of mine or just me trying to find a way to go back to college as I have had a hard time moving on though lol. \n\nI have been trying to find an RA job, then would go onto PhD after, but that has not been going well obviously. I am considering going out of the country to get my PhD, specifically the Netherlands. My plan would be to try an get into a masters program over there since its required. From what I hear with the different structure of PhDs being a job position rather than a student, being in the network and even having worked with PIs I want to be my mentor would be a huge advantage for landing a position. I am interested specifically in Netherlands or other EU institutions bc a few of them have this really big emphasis on art and science integration which is a personal interest of mine as fiber arts is my secondary passion/hobby. I had lots of opportunities to create neuroscience art integrated projects in my LAC and would love if that could continue to be a part of my life in science if possible. It would be my absolute dream to get involved with a art+science residencies where you collaborate with an artist and they use your reserach as a topic or inspiration for their art. Don't know how all that works or if thats feasable, but that combined with the Netherlands Institute of Neuroscience, neuroscience art competition, it just seems like the environment is a very aligned fit for me. Plus there are many desireable things about going aborad as a very introverted blunt American who LOOOOVES public tranit and human centric infrastructure. \n\nThat being said, if I do want to pursue LAC professor, it seems an EU PhD would be detrimental as you are not teaching and in general it seems EU education is more narrow and focused which is the opposite of liberal arts. Would it be reasonably possible to do research work for a portion of my life, either being a PI or staff scientist, then somehow pivot my career into LAC teaching later? \n\ntldr: thinking of getting my neuroscience masters then PhD in the EU, specifically maybe Netherlands. Wanting to be in academic research as a career, maybe as as a PI or high level staff scientist (like manager/coordinater/research associate), but also considering the route of trying to become a liberal arts professor as that is where I got my undergrad degree and I really love that environment. Any insight into the best decision for pursuing this career, esp with the state of the US right now.   \n  \nIk this is very specific and long, but does anyone have any experience or advice? Also if anyone has insight into what a european PhD is like compared to in the US, I know its a job position and you don't take classes and such, but is the general structure of mentorship to learn to do independent research different? is it more independent in the EU (specifically looking at Netherlands/Germany area) is there certain qualities of someone who might do better or worse in the environment of academia abroad vs  US?",

But I never done the course and my licence was cancelled, I done the course later only 8 months or so, and then went to court and got my licence but at vicroads they kept saying it was glitched or it said that mine never even come up as a drug driver. I got my licence back, and on the conditions on my card, and the vic roads digital licence it says none under my conditions. Is this what highway patrol or cops would be going off or will theirs say condition z and just say I were a tiny bit over 0.00 bac if breathod, would they know I’m meant to have the 3 year z condition and what will happen if it is literally not on my licence conditions?

Here’s your quick macro wrap for today (Oct 9, 2025).\n\n[Market snapshot image](https://s3.smartdeer.de/images/genai/mgiylogzuwszfwm38bq.png)\n\n**Highlights:**\n- Equities: Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Dow set new highs; tech and gold led; gold > **$4,000/oz**.\n- FX: Dollar index at a **1.75-month** high; euro and yen fell on political instability and weak data.\n- Autos: US tariffs could cut industry profits by ~**$30B** by 2025; margins down **100–150 bps**.\n- Growth/Policy: Wells Fargo lifts 2025 US GDP to **2.0%**; expects **two more Fed cuts** in H1 2026.\n- Energy: EIA boosts 2025–26 US oil output view to ~**13.5M bpd**; Brent crude **+1.21%**.\n\n*Sentiment snapshot:*\n- 📉 Bearish: Automakers most exposed include Toyota, Volkswagen, GM, Ford, Honda.\n- ⚠️ Uncertainty: Dollar strength tied to France/Japan politics; US shutdown risk and soft jobs add ambiguity.\n- 🚀 Bullish: Tech leadership to records; gold rallies on safe-haven demand.\n- 📈 Bullish: Upgraded US GDP and expected rate cuts support risk assets.\n- ⚖️ Mixed: High US supply keeps oil output strong; price path still uncertain.\n\n**Names in focus:**\n- **GM (GM):** Facing tariff-driven profit headwinds; investing **$4B** to localize US production as margins slip.\n- **Tesla (TSLA):** About **$300M** in added tariff costs on imported components despite US manufacturing base.\n- **Wells Fargo (WFC):** Raises US growth outlook; flags two more Fed cuts, citing resilient consumers and capex.\n- **ExxonMobil (XOM):** Guyana output advancing to **640,000 bpd**; French backing bolsters regional security.\n- **Toyota (7203.T):** Most exposed among global automakers to US tariffs; faces steep profit reductions.\n\n**Why it matters:** Record index levels alongside a surging dollar and gold signal a barbell market—growth and safety both in demand. Tariffs threaten auto margins and capex plans, while expected 2026 rate cuts may cushion valuations for tech and rate-sensitive sectors. Elevated US oil output could temper crude prices, aiding consumers but pressuring producers’ pricing power.\n\nWhere are you positioning next—stick with mega-cap tech and gold, or buy the tariff dip in autos and energy?\n\nFor faster headline alerts and market dashboards: [Download App](https://goto.smartdeer.org/?source=Reddit)",

    "content": "Markets roared back today with a strong rebound across major indexes — the **Nasdaq** surged about **+1.1%**, the **S&P 500** gained **+0.6%**, while the **Dow** held roughly flat. The rally was fuelled by a renewed wave of **AI optimism** and easing rate expectations after recent Fed comments hinted at potential cuts later this year.   \n  \nDespite lingering concerns over a possible government shutdown, investors shrugged off macro worries and piled back into growth and tech.\n\nThe heatmap lit up green, led by semiconductors and big tech. **#AMD** exploded **+11%**, while **#NVDA** climbed **+2.2%** and **#AVGO** added **+2.7%**. **#AAPL** rose modestly at **+0.6%**, **#MSFT** edged slightly higher, **#META** ended in green while **#GOOGL** was the lone big-tech laggard, dipping **–0.5%**. Over in enterprise software, **#ORCL** and **#PLTR** gained on AI-related momentum, and in streaming, **#NFLX** tacked on nearly **+2%**.\n\n**#AMZN** led retail with a **+1.5%** pop, **#TSLA** bounced back **+1.3%**, and defensives like **#JNJ** and **#LLY** stayed steady. Finance was mostly red with **#JPM** **#BAC #WFC** and **#GS** while **#BRK.B** held firm.  \n  \nOverall, it was a risk-on day — traders rotated back into high-growth names as optimism returned to the AI trade.   \n  \nThe question now: is this the start of a new leg higher or just another frothy rally before earnings season kicks in?\n\nMoneyvize makes it easier to spot where strength and weakness are concentrated — whether you’re tracking daily movers or looking for value in recently sold-off names.

An example of its effectiveness is a system that outperformed the S&P 500 over a 25-year period, utilizing the Price Rate of Change indicator.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tips for Stock Discovery Using Finviz:**\n\nTo identify potential breakout stocks, users can apply specific screener filters like \"Price crossed MA50 above\" and \"Gap Up 5%.\" \n\nFor locating potential short-squeeze candidates, filters like \"Float Short Over 30%\" and \"Option/Short - Optionable\" are useful. \n\nHowever, Finviz does not directly offer tools for finding undervalued stocks; for such a feature, platforms like Stock Rover are recommended, which provide detailed criteria including Fair Value and Margin of Safety for value-seeking investors.",

After following plenty of tutorials on Youtube on how to trade from the emulator to the physical I've done everything from making sure the dns on my 2DS (and even 3DS) matches that of the \"Siimmfi\" dns on the emulator. 2). There seem two be two connection issues I'm having a). on my 2DS side i get the message \"Unable to connect to Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection because the Wi-Fi User Information from the Nintendo ***DSi***  system and the save data do not match\" I'm unsure what this means if it has something to using the dns from \"Wiimmfi\" or something else but I'm lost here and not sure what to do to fix it. b). On my phone I am again using the \"Wiimmfi\" dns but i get a different error message when trying to connect to the \"Wi-Fi Club\" in the Poke Center, \"Error code: 60000\". I'm lost here as well as on the Delta Emulator \"Online Multiplayer\" help page it mentions I should just be able to restart the game, but this hasn't helped with my issue/s. \n\nIf i could get some guidance (hand holding) that would be much appreciated. :)",

    "content": "Build: Ventum GS 1 w/ Force xplr 1x13 drivetrain, 42T front ring. Zipp 303 xplr s wheelset with Goodyear xplr inters 45mm\n\nSize: M/L (I am 5’11”, 172lbs)\nWeight (with pedals): 18.3lbs\n\nMaiden voyage today of 44 miles, 1750ft of climbing on typical Midwest gravel, 12mph wind\n\nInitial thoughts: the ride is very comfortable. I was a bit worried I may be stretched too much for my comfort but wasn’t the case at all. I still need to make a few adjustments to the fit as I ride more but overall I have no complaints. Wheels and tires easily handled washboard sections and rutted dirt roads with ease. The shorter chain stays and overall geometry make for a nice nimble bike. It felt zippy but never unstable under foot. \n\nThe new Force XPLR 1x13 is great. Running a 42t chainring I did run out of gears on a couple descents with a tailwind but spent most of the time comfortably in the middle of the cassette. Gaps between gears didn’t feel too large at all and I am coming from a 2x 105 mech. Shifts are crisp. The bonus buttons automatically recognized my comp and switched easily between pages. \n\nThis bad boy wants to MOVE. I felt like it was begging to go faster and responds so quickly to power into the pedal. With a tailwind I felt like I was slicing down the road and into a headwind I didn’t feel dragged down. Despite the deep rims, the wheels never felt like sails in a crosswind. \n\nI don’t know what to make of the power meter yet. I was using Favero Assioma power pedals on my other bike and after this ride my training app detected an FTP increase of 4 watts. So either I need to recalibrate the new meter or this bike geometry is much more suited to power delivery than my previous bike. \n\nOverall first impressions are very positive, which is such a relief considering how much time I spent trying to decide which bike would be best for me. \n\n",

    "content": "Everyone obsesses over win rate. Almost no one truly understands R-multiple.\n\nBut after hundreds of backtested and live trades, I realized this metric is the single most important factor in long-term consistency\n\n[I track my trades using Tradezella.](https://preview.redd.it/laayrcvot6uf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=0aa6285dd71737c06b34ae0b943083abf1f84e6c)\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/the-truth-about-risk-to-reward-that-most-traders-dont-v0-u5tewbzu60uf1.png?width=1743&format=png&auto=webp&s=91fcf1a6a790d84bfe9325eeb4d1bbd9c3c6ebdb)\n\nR represents your risk unit, the foundation of risk management. It tells you how much you make or lose relative to what you risk. If I risk $500 and make $1,000, that’s +2R. If I lose $250, that’s -0.5R. The number itself doesn’t matter, the ratio does. Because in the end, your goal isn’t to win more trades; it’s to win bigger than you lose.\n\nOnce I started tracking every trade by R instead of dollars, the entire game shifted. I stopped judging myself by emotions or single outcomes and started focusing purely on consistency.\n\nWhat My Data Revealed\n\nI ran a full R-multiple analysis in my journal software and the results told me more about my trading than any mentor or YouTube course ever could.\n\nMy best performing range was between +1R and +1.99R, where I made $32,555.50 across 58 trades.\n\nOverall, my expectancy came out to +$98.88 per trade, even with a win rate of just 43.75%.\n\nAt first, those numbers surprised me. How could I be profitable while losing more than half my trades? But that’s the beauty of tracking R and not just win rate, it shows you that profitability isn’t about being right often; it’s about being right enough with proper risk and reward.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7pc9m52st6uf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=914681997fd3f69f1829f8aa7a4e9dfd9e5d9550\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/the-truth-about-risk-to-reward-that-most-traders-dont-v0-zcu91b1x60uf1.png?width=1720&format=png&auto=webp&s=03bfc71dff859cbeaf2018ac19451d6344078e4b)\n\nWhy It Matters So Much\n\nWithout a defined R structure, your emotions take over. You move stops mid-trade, take profits too early, or let losers run because you’re “sure” it’ll come back. That kind of decision-making kills consistency faster than any bad setup.\n\nWhen every trade is built around a fixed R framework, the chaos disappears. Your stop placement, your take profit, and your risk size are all predetermined before you click “buy.” You stop trading opinions and start trading probabilities. The difference between gambling and professional trading is structure and R-multiples create that structure.\n\nWhat I Learned\n\nAt first, I thought journaling was about reflection, writing down what I did right or wrong. Now I see it’s about data. Because when you know your R metrics, you can quantify your edge. You can model drawdowns, predict equity swings, and scale with confidence.\n\nI can take five straight losses and stay calm, because I know the math is still in my favor. My winners, on average, pay for those losses and more. That’s not mindset training, that’s statistical truth. Once you internalize it, you stop needing motivation to stay disciplined.\n\nMost traders fail not because their strategy doesn’t work, but because they’ve never defined their R. They don’t actually know what “good risk management” means beyond a stop-loss and a take-profit line.\n\nIf your trading system doesn’t have a consistent R framework, you don’t have an edge, you have a guess.\n\nBut when every trade is built on controlled risk and measured reward, your emotions lose power. Every win, loss, or breakeven becomes just another data point in a much bigger equation.\n\nTrading isn’t about predicting direction.\n\nAnd R-multiple is how you turn randomness into structure, structure into discipline, and discipline into results.",

    "content": "**System info:**\n\n* Windows version: Windows 10 22h2 (build 19045.6396)\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 7600 6-core\n* GPU: AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT\n* RAM: 32 Gb 4800Hz DDR5\n* Connection: Fiber (1000 Mbps up/down)\n* Router: Freebox Pop\n* Connection type: Ethernet / Wi-Fi\n* ISP: Free\n\n\n\n**Problem description:**  \nFor the last week or so I’ve been getting lag spikes while gaming, which is frustrating because I regularly do online pvp with friends. I've only been able to recreate the issue in Elden Ring.  \nThe spikes feel like other players suddenly freeze for 1–3 seconds, then teleport to their real position.  \nMy own character and game remain smooth, although I've heard some reports that my character starts to teleport around when moving which I think happens after or during the lag spikes.\n\nAt first I thought it was the game’s netcode, but I ran several tests:\n\n* Continuous ping to [8.8.8.8](http://8.8.8.8) in a command prompt → 0% loss, steady 16/17 ms latency\n* [Packetlosstest.com](http://Packetlosstest.com) → often get around 10% late packets with game open, no issues when closed\n* [Packetstats.com](http://Packetstats.com) → steady 25 to 35 ms when the game is closed, spikes of 400 or +1000 ms when game is open\n* Lag spikes happen even when Elden Ring is minimized\n* LatencyMon doesn’t report any issues\n* If launching the game offline, spikes still occur but much less frequently\n\n\n\n**What I've tried:**   \nRestarting the router, making sure the cables are plugged correctly (ethernet cord etc), updating drivers, restarting PC, reinstalling the game, changing CPU power settings to performance, excluding the game in Windows Defender, disabling overlays, limiting the bandwidth use of other apps with NetLimiter\n\n\n\nIs this a network instability (routing or ISP issue) or something local to my PC (CPU/network driver throttling, background process) and what else can I try in order to fix it ?\n\n\n\n**Screenshots / logs:**  \n[packetlosstest.com results while Elden Ring is closed](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/845772565993226250/1425881179252326504/image.png?ex=68e932d4&is=68e7e154&hm=a7587f3588f0db46d6843913cead101c73e2a917e72494ecac8a0fcd3c1ae818&)\n\n[packetlosstest.com results while Elden Ring is open](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/845772565993226250/1425881179663634472/image.png?ex=68e932d4&is=68e7e154&hm=92cf7baf6c1e6b8bf97b4654366781ab617f82d72475fae576a26bb0b1724a54&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=812&height=942)\n\n[packetstats.com while Elden Ring is open](https://prnt.sc/ELo98zCgmDZI)\n\n[packetstats.com after minimizing Elden Ring](https://prnt.sc/uj26-DNh6zJe)\n\n[packetstats.com during offline mode](https://prnt.sc/VdqiHxm-kyhR)\n\nI’ve already ruled out overheating and FPS drops — temps are normal (GPU \\~75°C, CPU \\~85°C).\n\n\n\n# TL;DR\n\nStable ping to Google, but games and latency tests show spikes. Happens even when game is minimized. Need help figuring out if it’s ISP routing or system-level.",

Now the company is being scrutinized by U.S. officials for its ties to China.\n\n**By** [Ana Swanson, ](https://archive.is/o/URIrm/https://www.nytimes.com/by/ana-swanson)[Tripp Mickle, ](https://archive.is/o/URIrm/https://www.nytimes.com/by/tripp-mickle)[Paul Mozur](https://archive.is/o/URIrm/https://www.nytimes.com/by/paul-mozur) and [Mara Hvistendahl](https://archive.is/o/URIrm/https://www.nytimes.com/by/mara-hvistendahl)\n\nAna Swanson reported from Washington; Tripp Mickle from San Francisco and Fremont, Calif.; Paul Mozur from Taipei, Singapore and Johor, Malaysia; and Mara Hvistendahl from Amsterdam.\n\nOn a humid June night last year, Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, held court with several of his company’s major Asian customers at a bar with sweeping views of Taipei. They stood and toasted the booming artificial intelligence industry.\n\n**Next to the Nvidia chief was a woman named Huang Le, or Alice Huang, an executive of a Singapore-based data center company called Megaspeed, which was poised to buy $2 billion of Nvidia A.I. technology over the next year.**\n\nThough Ms. Huang and Megaspeed are little-known players in the A.I. industry, their association with Nvidia and its chief executive has recently become a preoccupation in Washington.\n\n**Commerce Department officials have been investigating whether Megaspeed, which has close ties to Chinese tech firms, is helping companies in China sidestep American export restrictions, according to more than a half dozen current and former officials and other people familiar with the companies, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an examination that is not public.**\n\n**The inquiry, which is active, calls into question how closely Nvidia is tracking where its A.I. chips end up and highlights the possibility of American export laws easily being sidestepped. Megaspeed is also facing scrutiny from Singaporean police, who told The New York Times in a statement that they are investigating the company for breaching local laws, without elaborating further.**\n\nAs the dominant provider of artificial intelligence chips, Nvidia’s annual revenue have soared nearly sevenfold in the past four years, making it the world's most valuable publicly traded company. But the Silicon Valley company’s meteoric rise has coincided with U.S. government concerns that its chips could help adversaries like China develop new weapons, [surveil dissidents](https://archive.is/o/URIrm/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/world/asia/china-surveillance-xinjiang.html) and leap ahead of the United States [in A.I. development](https://archive.is/o/URIrm/https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/technology/what-is-deepseek-china-ai.html).\n\nThose concerns led both the [Biden](https://archive.is/o/URIrm/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/07/business/economy/biden-chip-technology.html) and [Trump](https://archive.is/o/URIrm/https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/technology/nvidia-h20-chip-china-restrictions.html) administrations to crack down on A.I. chip sales to China. But some Chinese companies employ global networks of middlemen and shell companies to sidestep those limits. In a legal gray area, some have built vast data centers in Southeast Asia that have fueled China’s gains in A.I.\n\nOther Chinese companies have [set up illegal smuggling networks](https://archive.is/o/URIrm/https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/04/technology/china-ai-microchips.html), moving perhaps hundreds of thousands of blocked chips into China, experts estimate. In April, the House Select Committee on China [opened an investigation](https://archive.is/o/URIrm/https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/technology/nvidia-deepseek-china-ai-trump.html) into Nvidia’s sale of chips to China and Southeast Asia. Nvidia has expanded its operations in Taiwan in recent years, but it remains firmly anchored to Silicon Valley, where it was founded more than three decades ago.\n\n**Megaspeed illustrates the challenges facing U.S. government officials trying to keep China from accessing powerful A.I. chips. After splitting off from a Chinese gaming company in 2023, Megaspeed set up a subsidiary in Malaysia that quickly snapped up nearly $2 billion worth of Nvidia’s most advanced products. Most of those chips came from the U.S. branch of a Chinese company that has already been sanctioned for providing technology to the Chinese military, according to records obtained through ImportGenius, a trade data platform.**\n\nMegaspeed has funneled those chips to **data centers in Malaysia and Indonesia** that appear to **remotely serve customers in China**. That is not necessarily illegal, but it can be found **unlawful if it is done on behalf of a Chinese company.** U.S. officials have also been scrutinizing whether Megaspeed diverted some of those chips on to China, in violation of U.S. law, two people familiar with the company said.\n\nThe Times visited sites in four countries, reviewed shipment records, business registrations, videos and photographs, and interviewed more than 30 people to shed light on Megaspeed’s opaque operation. Reporters tracked business listings that led to a **Malaysian data center and shopping mall, a near-empty office in Singapore and a dilapidated storefront outside Kuala Lumpur.**\n\n**Nvidia said there was no evidence that its chips had been smuggled into China.** John Rizzo, a spokesman for Nvidia, said in a statement that the chipmaker had “engaged with the U.S. government” regarding Megaspeed. Nvidia’s compliance team also looked into Megaspeed and determined it was “wholly owned and operated by a company based and headquartered outside China, with no China shareholders,” he said.\n\nMr. Rizzo said Nvidia had visited Megaspeed’s facilities multiple times. During a visit this week, he said Nvidia employees “found no evidence of diversion, and confirmed what we previously observed — Megaspeed is running a small commercial cloud, like many other companies throughout the world, as allowed by U.S. export control rules.”\n\n**Megaspeed said in an emailed statement that it “is a Singapore-based company, operating fully in compliance with all applicable laws, including U.S. export control regulations.”** It declined to comment further. Ms. Huang did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, said it did not comment on active enforcement matters and could not confirm or deny the existence of any pending investigations. It added that the Trump administration would aggressively investigate allegations of wrongdoing and that exporters should perform due diligence and investigate any red flags. The White House did not provide a comment.\n\n**Singapore’s Ministry of Home Affairs declined to comment. The Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry in Malaysia said that the country had recently strengthened its oversight of the export of A.I. chips and that it maintained an active dialogue with the United States about its controls.**\n\nAaron Bartnick, an assistant director for technology security and governance under the Biden administration, said Megaspeed raised **“many red flags,” including its ownership claims and possible ties to sanctioned entities**, that should have made Nvidia’s executives question whether they should have permitted the company to have access to its A.I. chips. “It’s hard to see a justification for taking that risk,” he said.\n\n# From China to Singapore\n\n**Megaspeed was created in 2023 when 7Road, a Chinese gaming and cloud computing company with ties to state-backed investors, split off its overseas operation in Singapore and renamed it Megaspeed.**\n\nMegaspeed listed Ms. Huang as its managing director for its first eight months before removing her from that role in its corporate paperwork. (She has also described herself as the company’s chief executive.) **The company’s current director is from Singapore but is based in Shanghai, according to business records and his social media account.**\n\nCompanies around the world were scrambling to buy the Nvidia chips used to build ChatGPT, which was released in November 2022. And the U.S. government was setting up a technological dragnet to stop advanced chip sales to China.\n\nIt is not clear when Mr. Huang and Ms. Huang, who are not related, first met. She was mingling with a crowd of tech executives just after midnight at the Taipei bar in early June of last year when she offered to ask Mr. Huang of Nvidia to join them, recalled Parker Schmitt, an executive who was with the group.\n\n**“She said, ‘I bet you guys I can get Jensen here,’ and then Jensen immediately showed up,” Mr. Schmitt said, referring to Mr. Huang by his first name. Photos posted to LinkedIn by NetThunder, a data software provider where Mr. Schmitt is chief executive, show Mr. Huang at the bar with the group.**\n\nShortly after Ms. Huang reached out, Mr. Huang arrived in his trademark black leather jacket and drank a whiskey shot with the group. He was accompanied by two other Nvidia executives and had planned to attend the party, said a person close to the company.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jsdzuffkw6uf1.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=d415430537a04bb3797dc48006617c76d4e6b7ee\n\n“Our field operations teams often host groups of customers and partners at conferences, and when Jensen is available, may ask him to visit to provide updates on the market,” Mr. Rizzo of Nvidia said.\n\nMr. Huang and Ms. Huang were photographed together again in May, exiting a restaurant in Taipei with an Nvidia aide after a business dinner with other A.I. suppliers. In a [video from the SET News channel](https://archive.is/o/URIrm/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxNH0SG8TFo) in Taiwan, she waited behind Mr. Huang as he passed out noodles from the restaurant to onlookers and spoke to the Taiwanese press.\n\n**Ms. Huang has a scant online profile. She spent much of her career in mainland China, including working as a television reporter for Chinese state media and as a private banker, according to a biography found on the social media of a former employer. The Times could not confirm either of those experiences. Ms. Huang left Megaspeed in recent months. The exact date is unclear. It is also unclear why she left and what she is doing now.**\n\nBoth she and 7Road, the Chinese company that Megaspeed split off from, have **close ties to a web of wealthy investors and tech companies with data center projects in China**, according to a review of corporate and trade records compiled by the platforms WireSreen and Sayari, and analysis by the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, a Washington nonprofit.\n\n**The owners of 7Road include the Chinese central government and several local governments. Before joining Megaspeed, Ms. Huang was executive director for a Shanghai-based fund that had invested in 7Road and had ties to state-backed firms.**\n\n# Valuable Shipments\n\n**It is not clear where Megaspeed’s billions of dollars came from to buy chips.** But a few weeks after the gathering in Taipei last year, Megaspeed began receiving a **steady supply of multimillion dollar shipments** of some of Nvidia’s most advanced chips, according to Malaysian trade records.\n\nThose purchases would have been **illegal under U.S. law** **if Megaspeed were still a Chinese subsidiary. But Nvidia had determined that Megaspeed was a Singaporean company**, said a person close to the company’s compliance division, and believed it was a newcomer to the cloud-computing industry that would compete for business against U.S. companies. Megaspeed, Nvidia officials said, did not raise any red flags.\n\n**Over the next three months, Megaspeed bought a billion dollars of Nvidia technology. Within the next nine months, it secured roughly a billion dollars more. Worldwide, Nvidia recorded roughly $115 billion in data center sales last year.**\n\nMalaysian import records show that the **bulk of those advanced Nvidia chips were purchased** from what WireScreen says is the **U.S. subsidiary of Inspur, a major Chinese tech firm** [**that the United States has sanctioned**](https://archive.is/o/URIrm/https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/business/economy/trump-chinese-tech-firms-chips-security.html) **for trying to acquire American technology** to build supercomputers for the Chinese military. Inspur and Aivres, the subsidiary, didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn 2023, Inspur was added to the U.S. entity list for supporting the Chinese military. The listing means that U.S. companies like Nvidia are barred from selling their technology to Inspur without a special license. **But because Inspur’s subsidiary, Aivres, is based in California and records sales as a U.S. company, it can buy Nvidia chips freely, legal experts said.**\n\nThe shipments went to **Speedmatrix, a subsidiary that Megaspeed had set up in Malaysia in early 2024**, according to shipment records obtained by ImportGenius, the trade data platform.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wkyrhvmrw6uf1.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=499ce5609636ef6771e898e58d725370e98bb1f7\n\nThe registered address for Speedmatrix on the shipping records led to a dilapidated storefront outside Kuala Lumpur, where the sign out front advertised a construction company.\n\nCalls by Times reporters to the construction company went unanswered, and no one was inside when a reporter visited the address in late September. **Employees at the law firm next door said they rarely saw people in the office.**\n\nIn September 2024, an official with the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security, the division of the Commerce Department that overseas export controls, visited Megaspeed’s data center in Malaysia to investigate suspicions about how much it was buying.\n\n**Officials were concerned that Nvidia technology on site was still in boxes**, three people familiar with the inspection said. Such behavior arouses suspicions because some companies **bypass checks by showing they have the technology before later shipping it elsewhere.**\n\nU.S. officials suspect that some of the chips may have been sent on to China, the people said, but they do not have conclusive evidence.\n\nAfter the visit, U.S. officials communicated their concerns about Megaspeed to Singaporean and Malaysian authorities, as well as Nvidia, the three people said. **The United States has been pressuring those governments to better police data center projects and chip smuggling networks.**\n\nIn February, Singaporean police arrested nine people, **including several Chinese-born executives of other technology companies**, **for making “misleading claims” about the end destination of computer servers that use the A.I. chips.** Malaysia said in July that it would require permits for all export and transfers of Nvidia chips.\n\nThe crackdown has **coincided with a stall in Megaspeed’s chip purchases.** By late July, trade records indicate that the company had stopped receiving shipments of advanced Nvidia chips, despite expectations that it would buy billions more. **Nvidia confirmed Megaspeed had not submitted new orders for months, but did not offer an explanation why.** The company was projected to buy as much as $3.2 billion of Nvidia’s highest-performing computers over the next year, according to Morgan Stanley. Those computers are packed with the company’s A.I. chips.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qeho08lvw6uf1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=3808ef80f918e4c05d0011447e8eeb65f0a26330\n\n# A Boom Fueled by China\n\nIn Singapore and Malaysia, traces of Megaspeed linger in half-empty offices, on corporate documents and behind the fences of advanced A.I. data centers.\n\nIn a premier office building in Singapore’s sleek central business district, just two employees were present on a recent weekday in Megaspeed’s offices. A door behind a small, staged waiting area gave way to a minimalist white office, with several clusters of empty desks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lynbnxwxw6uf1.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=5573da02f32e1418fb3872c3bc00dc2a230f748f\n\nA human resources manager said she had met few of the firm’s directors, **most of whom were based in China and seldom visited Singapore. Most of its clients, she added, are Chinese.** She said Ms. Huang had stepped down months earlier because of personal commitments to other businesses. \n\n**James Tan, who is listed in corporate records as the company’s Singaporean director, is never present, she said.**\n\nAccording to corporate ownership documents, **Megaspeed is owned by a shell company that Mr. Tan owns.** The shell company’s address led to an accounting firm in Singapore, where employees told a Times reporter that they **did not know how to reach Mr. Tan.**\n\nTwo hours north, hulking data centers rose over palm oil fields that dotted the Malaysian countryside. **Sedenak Tech Park, a complex of data centers with its own ties to China**, bristled with cameras and high-tension wires. **It was there that U.S. officials found Megaspeed’s inventory still in boxes.**\n\nIn Johor, the Malaysian state across the border from Singapore, Megaspeed’s Malaysian subsidiary, Speedmatrix, has an office on the upper floors of a shopping mall near snack stores and beauty parlors. The office’s windows were obscured by reflective glass and its doors were fitted with fingerprint scanners.\n\nWhen a Times reporter visited, three employees inside did not answer despite repeated knocks. A woman eventually emerged for lunch and identified herself as an administrator. She said she had no contact with her bosses.\n\n**When asked what the company did, she said, “It’s not clear.”**\n\nReporting was contributed by Pei-Lin Wu from Taipei; Berry Wang from Hong Kong; Zunaira Saieed from Kuala Lumpur and Johor; Nicholas Yong from Singapore; and Julian Barnes from Washington.

For example, forget Harmonix and Sirenix, Aisha could share her power with the winx either putting a protective bubble around them or turning them into mermaids (I was inspired by Kyzhea while writing this, look at their recent vid how she turn the winx into mermaid’s). Or forget Cosmix, Stella would share her power, either a small moon orbiting around the winx indicating that she is sharing her power or a halo. Flora, don’t worry girl, forget Sophix and she could give the winx a flower that wraps around there hand like vine indicating the transmision. \n\nYou get me right? There is so much for the plot and I might make a story with this story, so Ms. Girl, did I cook with these?\n",

    "content": "*“There's no need for everyone to be so afraid of new technology,”* Fred, the voice on the radio said in bewilderment. *“Express Electronics™ has been nothing but kind and generous to our whole city–and the world, for that matter. Wouldn't you agree, Harper?”*\n\nI raised an eyebrow as I drove to work, glancing from the road to the radio. The second host seemed hesitant when she answered.\n\n*“Well, Fred… I personally don't blame people that much. We've always liked to speak openly here on your show, right? It wouldn't be the first time something has gone wrong because profit was prioritized over safety. Remember when Express–”*\n\n*“Commercials!”* Fred interrupted.\n\nThe show was cut off suddenly. There was brief static before cheesy music started playing in the background.\n\n*“Harmless and clean– it leaves a great sheen! Try **Bustling Bubbles** today! It cleans your car, it cleans your kiddo, it cleans anything!”*\n\nI sighed, tapping my steering wheel as I waited at a stoplight. I don't know why I kept listening to this show, the ‘Fred Fast-talk’ show, except maybe to make myself angry.\n\nMaybe it was because I always felt guilty when I heard other stations bringing up the real concerns about Express’ actions. Especially considering my involvement.\n\n*I wish I could escape all of this…* I shoved away that thought quickly.\n\nAfter a further slurry of braindead advertisements, the talk show came back.\n\n*“Hi! Sorry for that sudden break, folks. I think we had a slip in the backroom. Someone throwing banana peels back there?”* A cartoon sound button played, followed by an awkward silence. *“Well were this my night show I'd expect a sea of laughter about now! But I'm sure you're all laughing in your cars. Speaking of my television night show, make sure to tune in tonight at eight p.m. central for the unveiling of Express’™ newest global innovation! I'm honored to be the choice delivery method of this exciting announcement. Remember, **‘If it's not Express™, it's not the best.’** See you tonight!”*\n\nA pre-recorded cheering track played as the outro jazz blared, and we were back to yet more commercials. I laid against my headrest.\n\nMy workplace was in the big city. We had our own parking garage at the law firm of *Jensen and Julliard*, but don't take the partner's spots or even God himself can't save you.\n\nSpeaking of parking, I was usually one of the last ones to arrive in the morning, which meant all of the good spots were taken in the upper floors. On top of that I was even more late because of damned construction.\n\nI simply refused to get up at three in the morning to save myself a small walk. So I had to park, as usual, in the ever-dark third floor basement. It even had flickering lights in some places. Dramatic.\n\nI closed my eyes as I mentally prepared for the day. It was always the same feeling. Not wanting to be home, and not wanting to be here. Either way, there was bound to be something unpleasant.\n\nI shut my car door and adjusted the purse over my shoulder. My heels clicked against the concrete as I walked, echoing amongst the empty darkness. It was so dim in fact that I thought about pulling out my phone's flashlight.\n\nI always felt some degree of nervousness walking through here. It didn't help that I already felt nervous about other things. For example, I was one of the lucky few that was on the partner track, being trained directly under Mrs. Jensen, whose mother was a founder of Jensen and Julliard. I wanted this. I needed it to stay that way, and yet…\n\n“The static is coming. The sickness will infect us all.”\n\nI stopped walking, blinked. I looked behind me, then to the side, but it was still just as dark as before. I couldn’t see a thing.\n\n“Hello?” My call echoed.\n\nOne of the nearby fluorescent lights flickered on. I turned, and saw someone lying against a chain link fence. A fence that protected some equipment or other. The person that sat there was an old woman with gray, wily hair, wrapped in third-hand coats.\n\nMy briefly racing heart slowed. I knew her. I took a calming breath, then walked towards her.\n\n“Ms. Alliebrow?”\n\nThe woman looked up at me with an expression of confusion. It slowly honed in, and shifted into a toothy smile.\n\n“Elaine? Is that you, dear?”\n\n“Ms. Alliebrow, you shouldn't sleep here,” I replied. “If the maintenance man or garage manager catches you, it'll–”\n\nThe woman lurched up suddenly, grasping my hand tight as her eyes widened. Her expression changed from smiling to warning.\n\n“The static comes, Elaine. Stay away from the screens. Be careful what you wish for.”\n\nI bit my lip. It was never easy to see someone forced to sleep on city sidewalks, but it would be worse if she was caught here.\n\n“Go to the shelter on fifth. They should be able to room you for a while, okay?”\n\nThe woman slowly sat again. In a gesture, I held out my hand instinctively, thinking I'd be helping her up, but she handed me something instead.\n\n“The time draws near. Keep this close, Elaine, and you'll be safe. Say hello to him for me.”\n\nShe stood up by herself and shuffled into the darkness. I watched her go. Eventually, I couldn't see her anymore. In looking down at my hand at what she had given me, I was confused. It was some strange piece of metal. Small, circular, intricate, and about the size of my palm.\n\nI wasn't sure if it was a piece of something down here, so I packed it into my purse and continued towards the elevator. I could hand it off to maintenance later. Onwards to my work day…\n\nMy reflection eyed me back as I stepped up to the shiny chrome doors of the elevator. The soft dings echoed as it passed each floor to eventually arrive. The doors closed behind me as I pressed the button for my floor. After a moment, I frowned. The elevator wasn’t moving.\n\n“Damn thing.” I muttered.\n\nThe button clicked as I smacked it a few more times. The light buzzed then, flickering on, and we were finally moving.\n\nI closed my eyes with a sigh. This ride was always the last peace before the chaos.\n\nIn the blackness, I felt a strange sensation. A fuzzy headache in the back of my skull. I frowned as I exhaled. Damn, this one hurt.\n\nKeeping my eyes closed only seemed to make it worse, so I opened them and took a pill from my purse. That’s right, no water bottle. I was a pro.\n\nThe TV mounted in the elevator flickered on. I glanced up at it. It was only filled with static, buzzing, but I thought I saw the flicker of a face. I tried to study it closer.\n\nThen suddenly, the doors opened.\n\n“There she is!” \n\nMy long stare jolted to surprise as my assistant, Jack, said this, arms outstretched. He had been standing there waiting by the doors…\n\n“Jesus. Are you trying to give me a heart attack?” I replied.\n\nWe entered the bustle of the firm together. Phones ringing and answered, people carrying more paper than should be humanly possible, and of course, an armada of corporate interior decoration.\n\nIt was quite the contrast to the dingy parking garage. I was convinced that the designers had simply purchased all of the gold accents that Target had to offer. \n\nJack looked at me conspiratorially.\n\n“Do you have any pressing work this morning?”\n\n“Not at the moment. Why?”\n\n“Then we're going to have breakfast in the food hall, and you're going to tell me all about it.”\n\n“I already had breakfast.”\n\nHe gave me a frank look.\n\n“Okay, maybe I didn't,” I admitted. “But I don't know what you're talking about anyway.”\n\n“Oh, sure. Who would have anything to say about how you saved Express Electronics singlehandedly, becoming the favorite person of–”\n\n“All right fine,” I interrupted. “but you're buying, got it?”\n\nWe walked through the extensive corridors until we made it to the food hall, passing many other paralegals on the way. It wasn't anything too large, and we shared it with all of the businesses in this building, but it was nice.\n\nA coffee place, a sandwich joint, and a few other fast food locations were set up throughout. The seating was in the middle, the businesses on the edges. \n\nOne particular restaurant specialized in breakfast, so we ordered our food from there. Jack did actually pay for me. To him though that was likely a symbol that he'd effectively paid for my story too…\n\n“So? Tell me everything.” He said eagerly, having vacuumed up his breakfast to ask questions faster. I was still on mine.\n\n“It was nothing really.” I muttered between bites of an egg sandwich.\n\n“Come on! You've gotta tell me where you get that courage.”\n\nI sighed.\n\n“Really, it's not a big deal. I just made a casual suggestion during a war room. I can't really talk about the details, but–”\n\n“Please. Just a ‘casual suggestion?’ You and Mrs. Jensen were *presenting* to the *admin*. It was all over the schedule for that conference room.”\n\nI glared.\n\n“Do you actually want to hear the story or not?” \n\nHe shrugged and sat back, zipping his lips. I continued after another bite.\n\n“Like I said, I can't talk about the details, but I re-read the case files for a couple of days before I saw an opening.”\n\n“And?” Jack chimed.\n\n“*And* yes. My strategy caused Judge Adamson to grant us a stay.”\n\n“A *stay*. On a class action suit this big? Even Adamson must know that they'll just be able to launch it now with no problems before any real barricades come up.”\n\n“Yep.”\n\n*Not to mention that Adamson was our preferred Judge…* I thought.\n\nJack rolled his eyes.\n\n“Just admit it. You blew their socks off with your brilliance and now you’re leaps and bounds up the partner track. Rumor has it that Mrs. Jensen is pretty pleased with you.”\n\nI looked up at that.\n\n“You think so?”\n\n“Honey, you're already passed the glass ceiling,” He leaned in to whisper. “I also heard that Mrs. Jensen has someone important she wants you to meet today. It's been pretty hush-hush, but everybody saw the unmarked black vehicles pull up.”\n\nI continued with my breakfast without a reply. Jack seemed to study me, as if he had just noticed something.\n\n“Are you okay, Elaine?”\n\n“Yeah. I've just been having strange dreams lately.”\n\nJack shook his head.\n\n“Whatever you say…”\n\n-\n\nAs the day went on, Jack ended up being exactly right.\n\nAfter we had finished breakfast and got back to work, lunch came and went, then a dough-eyed new hire came to tell me that Mrs. Jensen wanted to see me in her office.\n\nDespite my good standing, I couldn't help but feel nervous. Jack was usually right about rumors, so what ‘important person’ did Mrs. Jensen want me to meet?\n\nI rode the admin elevator to the uppermost floor. The twentieth floor. It was also the nicest looking area of the building. Garish carpets for an office, plants, large paintings on the wall, the whole nine.\n\nIt was down the hall and up to a reception desk to reach my destination. The woman sitting at that desk stood with a smile.\n\n“Mrs. Edwards. Please wait here while I check if they're ready for you.”\n\nI heard muffled laughter from the office as I sat down. The receptionist waited a polite amount of time after the sound before dialing her phone. I shuffled nervously.\n\n“Mrs. Edwards is here. Yes, I'll send her in.”\n\nShe turned back to me and smiled again.\n\n“They're ready for you.” \n\nThe receptionist stood, walking forward to open the door for me. I took one more second to breathe before standing up myself.\n\nMrs. Jensen's large office was filled with modern decor, placed throughout to give the room fluidity. Wavy, wooden tables with glass tops. Short, square couches that could in no universe be comfortable, and of course, quite the city view. Even though it was only about twenty stories up, it was still impressive what you could see from all the way up here.\n\nI swallowed. I felt like a lamb in the den of a lioness. No, a *mouse* in the den of a lioness. \n\nI could no longer delay with distraction once I looked toward the great oak desk in the back. There were two people there. Mrs. Jensen of course, her professional air buttoned up tight into a custom suit, but there was also a tall man with a permanently smug expression. His hair was slicked back, clothes expensive looking if not very stylish.\n\nMrs. Jensen smiled as she turned to greet me.\n\n“Why, hello again.” She said as her receptionist closed the door. I crept forward warily.\n\n“How are you, Elaine?”\n\n“Good… um how are you?”\n\n“Good. I'm also good. Good weather we're having.”\n\n“Good…” I muttered.\n\nMrs. Jensen was about to reply before the man stepped forward, laughing.\n\n“Not one for small talk? I get it, me neither. Let's skip to business then,” The man shook my limp hand. “So then. You're the hero?”\n\nI must have had quite the ‘help me’ expression, because Mrs. Jensen stepped in to save me.\n\n“Where are my manners? Elaine, this is Bobby Dicksson, the CEO of Express Electronics. Mr. Dickson, this is Elaine Edwards.”\n\nThat information did not save me at all.\n\n“Bobby please. Mr. Dickson was my father.”\n\nA silence stretched on as we all stared at each other. Was this the moment where I said something? Worry clawed at my gut as I reached for words. *This* guy was the head of Express? That somehow made terrible sense… I clamped that thought shut before I accidentally said it out loud.\n\n“Uh– wow, hi.” Was all I managed. Bobby raised an eyebrow at me.\n\n“It's alright. People are always stunned by me, even when my dad was still in control. So, you *are* the hero then, yeah? You made that iron solid defense for me?”\n\n“I did.” I said, managing a small smile.\n\n“Well then. You don't seem too proud of it.” Bobby said.\n\n“Sorry if we seem tired,” Mrs. Jensen interjected. “We've had several long days of making sure everything was in order for you. We may have stalled things, but we've still got a battle plan to make.”\n\n“Understandable. Well, as a reward, I suppose I should give you ladies a little hint… We've been testing ‘E.E.’ already in pockets throughout the city. We think this'll be a great launch. The markets just can't predict my genius, I tell you.” \n\n*E.E.?*\n\nMrs. Jensen smiled as Bobby laughed hard at his own joke.\n\n“That's great, Bobby. I'm sure E.E. will be remembered for generations to come.” Mrs. Jensen said. Bobby paused, then looked at us both pointedly.\n\n“You know what? I think I'm suddenly into lawyer ladies. What would you two say we all go and get a drink? My treat. We can ditch this snobby palace for somewhere with liquor. We can even take my sweet red Ferrari…”\n\nBobby waggled his eyebrows. Mrs. Jensen chuckled with the artificial flavor that only an uncomfortable corporate big wig can manage.\n\n“We're of course flattered by the offer, but unfortunately, we're both married.” She said.\n\nBobby shrugged.\n\n“Doesn't have to mean anything. Come on. Based on your looks you probably haven't slept with your husbands in, what, ten years? They’re probably salty old men anyways. Could be fun…”\n\nNeither of us said anything. Bobby frowned.\n\n“But– suit yourself, I guess. I appreciate your hard work. Keep at it, sport.” He patted my shoulder, and strode off. “We can have a bright future together. Anyways, I better get going.”\n\nI heard him mumble to himself as he opened the door.\n\n“Stiff bitches…”\n\nMrs. Jensen and I exchanged a glance.\n\n“So, Elaine,” She said quickly, as if to wash the interaction away. “Any new ideas on our next strategy? The CPA isn’t just going to roll over.”\n\nWe sat and talked legal jumbo for a while. I was right. The green, upholstered, very square ‘chairs’ were definitely not comfortable. Still, it was easier to just talk to Mrs. Jensen than Mr. Dickson, but I was still nervous. She was kind of an assertive presence. \n\nShe showed me further details of the case, and I made more suggestions. She commented on how young blood always had the sharpest eye for this, and even told me a little about herself.\n\n“You know, I didn't want to be a lawyer originally.” She said.\n\n“Really? But you're so good at it. You really harness the courtroom. What did you want to be?”\n\nShe chuckled, smiling.\n\n“Don't laugh. An actress…”\n\nI smiled.\n\n“I could see that. I mean, the courtroom is pretty much a stage.”\n\nEventually, I left her office to do my own work. Pretty soon though the work day ran out. My only option was to go home. To my surprise, Mrs. Jensen caught me again just as I was taking the elevator.\n\n“Oh, Elaine?”\n\n“Yes, Mrs. Jensen?”\n\n“Sorry about him earlier. Just try to ignore it.”\n\nI gave her a fake smile, nodded, and kept on.\n\nMy thoughts were cloudy as I drove back home. \n\nThat damned construction was causing bumper to bumper traffic downtown. It gave me plenty of time to think I guess, whether I wanted it or not. Also plenty of reasons to honk at other drivers.\n\n*“We've already got a lot of speculation on Express’™ newest project,”* Said Fast-talk Fred. *“Lots of posts on Fred's Forum about how positive everyone is. Of course there’s a few misguided stinkers, but we all know they're just trolls anyway. What do you think, Ginnie?”*\n\n*“Well, Fred, I know we can't say much about the new innovation just yet, but I can tell you this, folks. I've been lucky enough to have a sneak peak and I must say it'll change our lives forever! Express Electronics™ is truly a boon.”*\n\nA strange, chilly sensation crawled up my neck. It must be that damned headache from earlier… I guess the acetaminophen had worn off. I rubbed my temple with a free hand.\n\n*“That's great to hear, Ginnie, and I agree! You know, while we can't tell you the secret just yet, I **can** offer you all another surprise! Thanks to Express Electronics™ becoming an affiliate of my shows, we're prepared to offer you a special **20%** discount across Express’™ entire website! You heard that right, folks. They're so excited about their new product that you could get a new phone, television, or whatever you need at a cut!”*\n\nPre-recorded clapping played.\n\n*“You know, my teenage daughter has been begging me for her own phone. How do we get this discount, Fred?”*\n\n*“Glad you asked, Ginnie. Just use code **‘FRED’** at online checkout or even in-store! That's code **‘FRED.’**”*\n\n*“Really? That's great! You know what else is great?”*\n\nThere was a pause before Fred replied. His words were slow and dark.\n\n*“Why yes, Ginnie. I do.”*\n\nThe pressure in my head built. I winced as I reached towards the radio dial. Maybe turning down the volume would help?\n\nGuess I was going to have to take another pill when I got home. I was so focused on the pain in my skull that I didn't notice until moments later that the radio was silent. Silent for several noticeable seconds. Only static hummed, all until one sentence was spoken.\n\n*“Elaine wants to escape.”*\n\nMy car came to a slow halt at a red stoplight. Had I heard that right? I sat there in confusion, breathing shallow breaths. \n\nI saw something out of the corner of my eye. A smiling, familiar face, peering into my window. I gasped as I flipped sideways to look at it– but something changed. *Everything* changed. Like watching the sky, then being forced underwater, my vision darkened. I was going deeper, deeper, until no light was reaching me. When that darkness faded, things were different.\n\nTerror filled me as I looked outside of my windshield. The city was gray, full of abandoned vehicles, and so, so empty.\n\nI tried to open my door to see what was wrong, but it locked itself. That talk show host spoke from the radio again, his voice low.\n\n*“He'll be a real asshole tonight. He'd rather ignore you than deal with what he's done,”* Fred tsked. *“There's just no helping you, is there? A case as lost as a ship at sea. At least, not until E.E. helps us all. Helps you, even though you don't deserve it, but you **do** deserve everything else, don’t you?”*\n\nThat haze in the back of my head seemed to stab at me. Soft, then sharp, pulling me painfully backwards.\n\n*“The doors will open and the world will be changed. A gray world in a gray mind overtaken by its own greed. Watch the screens, Elaine. Watch the **screens**.”* Fred began to laugh. A laugh that echoed darkly.\n\nThat laugh began to sound strange. It burbled oddly into a whining sound that pushed at me. Louder, louder. \n\nThen I recognized it. I blinked. The sound was a car horn behind me. \n\nI gasped shakily for air as though I really had been in water. The pain faded. The radio continued jauntily.\n\n*“That's right, and I've just gotta remind you folks that it's sitewide! Don't forget about their in-store trade-in value.”*\n\nThe world was… back to normal? Crowded sidewalks, bustling traffic, and colors. No more of that lifeless gray.\n\nThe car behind mine honked again, the driver shouting angrily. I waved dismissal as I continued through the now green traffic light.\n\nI glanced down at the radio again.\n\n*“I just can’t believe how gracious they are. Express is truly–”*\n\nI turned the radio [off.](https://www.reddit.com/user/WhisperWoodsStories/comments/178oho8/hello/)",

    "content": "Looking for clarification on the 2x AXP hours for NCARB Certificate. I am a licensed Architect (Wisconsin) and working on reciprocity with another state (Texas). I do not have a NAAB accredited degree, but I am needing to be NCARB Certified for reciprocity in Texas. Since I do not have a NAAB accredited degree, I am working on completing the 2x AXP hours Education Alternative.\n\nI already have 3,740+ AXP hours logged and approved as they were required in order to be eligible to take the exams. I have been in contact with NCARB and the individual I am corresponding with has outlined that I will need an additional 2x AXP hours, which would be an additional 7,480 hours. Furthermore, this individual has stated that these hours are logged \"post registration\". This would mean a total of 11,220 hours (3,740 for exam approval, and then 7,480 for 2x AXP for NCARB Certification \"post registration\").\n\nThis seems to be in contradiction with NCARB's **Education Guidelines PDF - page 15 - Step 3: Satisfy Deficiencies - Documenting 2X AXP**, which states \"Any hours already approved will count toward this requirement\".\n\nAny insight is greatly appreciated. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the NCARB individual, but we've been going back and forth on this for a few weeks. Thank you!",

I replaced the egg water and then boiled 4 dumplings. \nI then replaced the water and made two servings of great value instant rice, to which I added two servings or 1tbsp of pokekake furikake seasong and 1.5 tsp of ([fake lol] great value) soy sauce. \nWhile the rice was boiling I had chopped up 2/3 of a cucumber. \nFinally I replaced my water again and added the boiled water to a bowl containing the contents of the miso packet and topping packet and stirred it into miso soup.\nI then plated everything into two tupperwares for easy comparison to simplify halving the portion (I don't mind eating a meal out of a plastic container if it makes things easy anyways). \nAnd there you have it!!! \nIs this authentic Japanese cuisine?? No.\nIs it delicious and low cal? Yes.\nDoes this quite qualify as high volume? Debatable.\nWas it extremely filling and low calorie? ABSOLUTELY!!\n420 cal and 33g of protein for the spicy tuna, rice, egg, and dumplings. \n35 cal and 2g of protein for the tofu flavor instant miso soup.\nIf I make more soup packets I just got 4 meals technically out of this (although I intended on only yeilding two). \nI don't have a food scale so that is why I didn't provide gram weights, however I just use math and measuring cups, and I've lost over 30lbs without needing a food scale so I don't believe I'm off. Calories are rounded up to the nearest 5cal and protein is rounded down to the nearest whole gram. ",

    "content": "Hey guys, it’s my first post here, so, if been having this idea a long time ago, it’s about a character that is like a mix of doom slayer, kratos, guts from berserk, and a crusader, he is a “chosen one” from god, which his mission is to ”unalive” all lust or dirty thing, like, EVERYTHING, no matter if it’s abstract, alive, or even beyond his capabilities.\n\nHe is very much the doom slayer but instead of demons, it’s just lustful people, succubi, incubi, etc, he doesn’t kill any demon, only the lustful ones, if he was in the middle of hell, he wouldn’t kill any demon that is just violent\n\niv got this idea a long time ago when iv seen so much status, pootis, etc videos(those where it’s a ”dirty video” and when it’s about to show something, it cuts to a character slashing the screen or stopping it) that I thought “hey, what if there was a guy that his whole life was doing something like that?” and so, voila\n\nThe second image is a scuffed ragged showcase of what I meant, like what he would do pretty much, after killing any lustful thing(or just making their lives normal and ”pure”) he’d make a small pray to send these people to a better place where they wouldnt have any lust or ”unholiness”\n\nCurrently, I don’t have any idea or concept for him, just how his body would be like and his face, but it’s still missing too much, and I can’t get any ideas, like, he looks bald, and idk how to make a helmet that fits him, or if I give him hair, or not, and a lot of other issues, if you could, pls give me ideas or possible things I could add to him and il try to extend it, thx :)\n\nP.S: his body is based on absolute bane",

    "content": "**Finviz Defined:**\n\nFinviz stands as a stock market analysis platform headquartered in New York, serving both individuals and institutional clients.

Users can swiftly sift through stocks, observe market movers, and receive a comprehensive overview of the financial markets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pros of Finviz Features:**\n\nAccess to 67 unique stock screening metrics\n\nRecognition of 33 distinct chart patterns\n\nReal-time data and 1-minute interval updates with Finviz Elite\n\nRenowned as one of the superior free stock screening utilities\n\nEfficient tracking of market insider transactions and news updates\n\nQuick visualization of sector and industry trends through heatmaps\n\nSeamless integration of news from various sources\n\nComprehensive backtesting capabilities recognizing an array of chart patterns\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cons of Finviz:**\n\nElite backtesting features could offer more versatility\n\nA limited set of 21 chart indicators\n\nAbsence of dedicated mobile applications for both Android and iOS devices\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Functionality Across Devices:**\n\nFinviz operates effortlessly across computers, tablets, and smartphones via web browsers without the need for any software installation. Users, upon signing into Finviz, are welcomed by a dashboard that provides a snapshot of the day's market trends, top-performing stocks, recent news, and significant insider trading actions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Finviz Application Availability:**\n\nCurrently, Finviz does not offer an application for download from either the Android Play Store or the Apple Store. It is advised to access Finviz through conventional web browsers on computers or tablets.\n\n People might mistakenly install the FINWIZ app, but it is not the same company. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Insights into Finviz Heatmaps:**\n\nFinviz's heatmaps offer a dynamic visualization of the US and global stock market performances, pinpointing potential trading opportunities. The platform's ability to compile and display a comprehensive heatmap with such rapidity is noteworthy. Users can gain insights into the latest stock performances, trend lines, and competitor comparisons by simply hovering over stock tickers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c0tt7a47r6zb1.jpg?width=1274&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3f3a6517e756611e5e65c828df160e7d087e354\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Market Visualization and Analysis:**\n\nFinviz excels in presenting market data across various filters such as stock price changes, trading volumes, P/E ratios, and more, including analyst recommendations. The platform facilitates direct navigation to detailed company information and charts with remarkable speed and efficiency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Evaluation of Finviz Stock Screener:**\n\nFinviz's screener empowers users to quickly sort through over 8,500 stocks and ETFs based on 67 financial and technical criteria, coupled with 30 trading signals. While it offers a substantial range of filters, competitors like TradingView, Portfolio123, and Stock Rover provide even more extensive filtering options. Nonetheless, Finviz stands out by allowing screenings based on candlestick and chart patterns, catering to both investors and traders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wcr435x9r6zb1.jpg?width=1273&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e25c16c31a965de1d9cb606aa9cb96c393548914\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Analysis of Finviz Charting:**\n\nFinviz provides essential daily chart pattern recognition and a select number of overlays and indicators, differentiating it from platforms like MetaStock and TradingView. The inclusion of automatic trendline detection and pattern identification offers significant advantages for traders focused on patterns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Enhancements in Finviz Elite Charting:**\n\nThe continuous development of Finviz Elite has resulted in notable improvements to interactive charting, including the addition of Heiken Ashi charts and more indicators and overlays. The new auto-save feature for charts and annotations further enhances the user experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/alyszlpcr6zb1.jpg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d40e73209dbfce747ef92d7ee3b770532132590c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Guide to Building Backtests in Finviz:**\n\nFinviz's backtester is a powerful tool with over 100 indicators, offering automated chart pattern recognition to aid in creating distinctive trading systems. An example of its effectiveness is a system that outperformed the S&P 500 over a 25-year period, utilizing the Price Rate of Change indicator.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tips for Stock Discovery Using Finviz:**\n\nTo identify potential breakout stocks, users can apply specific screener filters like \"Price crossed MA50 above\" and \"Gap Up 5%.\" \n\nFor locating potential short-squeeze candidates, filters like \"Float Short Over 30%\" and \"Option/Short - Optionable\" are useful. \n\nHowever, Finviz does not directly offer tools for finding undervalued stocks; for such a feature, platforms like Stock Rover are recommended, which provide detailed criteria including Fair Value and Margin of Safety for value-seeking investors.",

Becoming an Architect has been my life long dream , only to be demotivated by some of my senior leadership.  \n  \nWe all know experience matters ,but if someone passes the same exams, logs the same AXP hours, and meets NCARB’s standards, shouldn’t they be celebrated, not questioned?\n\nToo often, early licensure gets met with quiet skepticism:\n\n* “You’re too young to stamp drawings.”\n* “You still need a few more years.”\n* “Back in my day, it took a decade.”\n\nBut here’s the truth: competence isn’t a function of age ,it’s a reflection of effort, discipline, and accountability.  \nIf someone earns their license early, they didn’t skip the process , they mastered it faster.\n\nArchitecture needs more people who raise the bar early, not those who guard the gate longer.\n\nMaybe it’s time the profession celebrated ambition instead of policing it.",

After an inspection from my insurance and mechanic, it was deemed a total loss.  \n\nInsurance payout was quick and I turned around picking up a 24 T7 with 1500 miles from a friend.

    "content": "Im planning on making a downsize to a Terra, and I’m researching day and night, trying to understand TDP, max watt and so on.\nI’m planning a mid build, using the 9600x or the 9700x.\n\nThe easy one would be to use the NH-L12S, but I’ve set my eyes on the Gigabyte B650i Ultra board, due to its 3 nvme slots. \nProblem is I won’t be able to fit those two in the terra, so I would have to use another cooler, like the AXP(90 or maybe 120?)\nOr the L9.\n\nSince I’m very noise sensitive, I need the option that can handle the CPU’s without spinning 2000 rpm everytime I do something cpu intensive.\nI’m not planning on anything like AI or blender, just some photoshop and light video editing.\nWhat would my best options be?",

    "content": "[EA FC 26 Clubs](https://preview.redd.it/j5ssl64yinsf1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=9db65cdc74ebea489d81dea7ee19909b7fc49782)\n\n Increasing the Attribute Points (AP) of your Pro (your player character) is crucial to becoming indispensable in EA FC 26 Clubs. However, many players find leveling too slow at the beginning of a season and struggle to efficiently improve their Attributes. This article will delve into several methods for rapid leveling and help you optimize your resource usage and increase your speed.\n\n# How to Quickly Level Up and Gain Attribute Points in FC 26 Clubs?\n\nInstant AXP Packs are currently one of the fastest ways to level up. You can purchase these packs through the Club Store or receive them as rewards from the Season Pass. Using these packs allows you to quickly gain multiple levels of Attribute Points without having to play many matches. However, these instant packs are extremely useful below Level 25. Once you reach this level, you won't be able to level up with these packs alone; you'll need to earn Experience Points through actual in-game performance.\n\nBoosters and multipliers are another speed-up tool. Certain items can increase your experience multiplier (e.g., 1.75x, 2x, or 3.5x), or you can earn more AXP by completing skill and match mini-games. These tools can significantly reduce leveling time in the early stages, but their effectiveness decreases after level 25.\n\n# Which modes and activities are most worth grinding?\n\nSkill mini-games are cheaper than playing full matches. For example, a game like \"Extreme Hot Potato\" can earn around 1,000 AXP in 8-10 minutes, allowing you to quickly advance through multiple levels. These mini-games are low-risk and require little time, making them ideal for training and when resources are limited.\n\nAfter reaching level 25, you must start playing official match modes to earn significant experience. League division matches are a great way to gain high ratings and experience points, especially if you receive good reviews. You can earn 200 to 500 experience points per game. By using experience multipliers (such as AB Boost or other tools), experience points can be increased to between 1,000 and 2,000. Drop-in matches are also a good option, as they require more time and experience, but require more efficiency.\n\n# AXP Pack Prices and Consumption in FC 26 Club\n\nIn the Club Shop, you can see the prices of different tiers of Instant AXP Packs and items with different experience multipliers. For example:\n\n* 1,500 Instant AXP (max 2): 5,000 Club Coins / 150 FC Points\n* 3,000 Instant AXP (max 2): 10,000 Club Coins / 200 FC Points\n* 1.75x AXP–5 matches (max 2): 5,000 Club Coins / 100 FC Points\n* 2.0x AXP–5 matches (max 2): 10,000 Club Coins / 150 FC Points\n* 3.5x AXP–5 matches (max 2): 15,000 Club Coins / 350 FC Points\n* 6x AXP–5 matches (max 1): 30,000 Club Coins / 500 FC Points\n\n Club Coins or FC Points are typically used to pay for purchases. If you want to level up quickly, it's best to choose cost-effective, reusable multiplier packs rather than relying solely on the highest multiplier. This not only conserves resources but also avoids waste caused by declining efficiency after reaching a certain level.\n\n# Is storing enough FC 26 Coins useful in the FC 26 Club?\n\nWhether playing in Clubs or Ultimate Team, having ample resources will ensure rapid growth in EA FC 26. This is where M8X (formerly FIFACOIN) comes in.\n\nFIFACOIN is one of the most established platforms in the FUT community, renowned for its secure transactions, fast delivery, and automated trading technology. With the rebranding, M8X will continue to provide the same reliable service for the **FC 26 Coins**, but with a completely new platform. M8X supports all FIFACOIN features and services.\n\nIn addition to making effective use of instant AXP packs and multiplier items, you'll also need sufficient EA FC 26 Coins. Using instant AXP packs, experience multipliers, and choosing efficient game modes (such as Drop-In, Skill Games, and League Divisions) are key to quickly improving your FC 26 Clubs' Pro stats. Before reaching Level 25, these strategies can significantly accelerate your progress, allowing you to build your ideal Playstyles and Specializations by the beginning of the season.\n\nIn short, using the right strategies can help FC 26 Clubs level up and improve their stats. By using instant AXP packs, experience multipliers, and investing time in the right modes, you can achieve significant progress in a short period of time, growing faster as a Pro and fully unlocking skills and traits to help you stay invincible on the field. Whether you're a competitive or casual player, these methods will make playing FC 26 easier and more efficient.",

    "content": "Altar-assisted Xom scumming\n\nIf you abandon a god you are put under penance. However, if you then rejoin the same god you will no longer be under penance, and your piety will be reset to the starting value. This can be exploited with Xom, since unlike with other gods, Xom piety doesn't start at 0, it starts in the middle, displayed as value 4 out of 7.\n\nSo if you have an access to a Xom altar you can abandon Xom and immediately rejoin, with no penalty, and your piety will be set to the middle value. If your piety is at any of the 3 lowest values you can go to a Xom altar and increase your piety.\n\nHow useful is this? If you are far away from a Xom altar, then by the time you get back to an altar your piety may change, and if you have a decently strong character you can generally keep fighting and use up low Xom piety on enemies, as in combat Xom actions are skewed towards combat-oriented actions. But if there is a Xom altar relatively closely, then it can be worth it to go to an altar and reset your piety.\n\nAltar-assisted Xom scumming is most useful when type 1 Xom scumming. If you find a Xom altar early on in the game before you reach level 9, then resetting your piety at an altar when it reaches one of the 3 lowest values will increase the number of positive Xom actions, and ideally you would be doing it.\n\nContext: [http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Chaos\\_Knight\\_of\\_Xom\\_Guide#Altar-assisted\\_Xom\\_scumming](http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Chaos_Knight_of_Xom_Guide#Altar-assisted_Xom_scumming)",

    "content": "Listen up, fellow apes. While the penny market is slow and choppy today—full of gap-and-fade traps it's the perfect time to look for names that are de-risking their story.\n\nInstead of chasing today's micro-moves, let's talk about a diagnostics play, Mainz Biomed (MYNZ), that has a clear roadmap of catalysts coming up, making it a solid target to scale into on weakness.\n\nWhy MYNZ is in the \"Setup\" Category\n\nThis company, which is focused on its non-invasive CRC test ColoAlert®, has lined up some huge events over the next six months that could easily drive a re-rate:\n\n1. Major European Expansion: They just got full authorization to market their test, ColoAlert®, in the U.K. (Sept 2, 2025) and are doing a full commercial launch in Switzerland (Sept 23, 2025). That's access to two big, new populations. Look for early revenue updates from these markets.\n2. The Big US Catalyst (Q4 2025): The company is on track to release the crucial top-line data from their eAArly DETECT 2 study by Q4 2025. This data is key because it will set the stage for their massive US pivotal study in 2026. This is the main spec catalyst to watch for.\n3. New Pipeline Validation: Beyond colon cancer, they are also moving forward with a test for pancreatic cancer (PancAlert). The program just got a boost with government funding and is entering feasibility testing. If they confirm the early, highly positive discovery results, it will add a lot of value to the pipeline.\n\nUBER SLMT AMD DHI TNMG TCRT AEI MSTR BAC GSIW ANIX ISPC ELAB HIT GPUS CCHH ABBV QUBT AMZN SES GWAV XOM XBIO BGMS AREC HOWL BMEA SFHG T ZONE CCTG NXXT CFLT ALAB RGTI GLTO LCFY TRUE PMEC BJDX EPWK DVLT SKYE BENF TELO PWM PHOE JPM TRX HUMA BNBX TTD CLIK WMT SMSI META INTU SKYE ARBE UNH MSPR INTC EPSM EDSA PANW FIG UAMY RVSN CRVO FPAY FBLG CCTG YYAI LLY RVPH PLTR ZNB DVLT BQ INDP PL SCWO ZBIO ATON MSN APM WDC GLTO CRM SNGX ELPW PCSA CLYM KLAC NKE IBM VIVK HD SMCI MTEN QCOM NVDA CLIR QTTB CISS DLXY GORV\n\nThe Bottom Line:\n\nIn slow, choppy market conditions like today's, we avoid chasing thin, newsless pumps. We focus on building positions in names that have a clear catalyst roadmap and are actively executing their business plan like MYNZ with its European commercial wins and the upcoming US data readout in Q4.\n\nManage your risk, respect key levels, and let the company's execution drive the move, not daily noise.\n\nWhat other de-risked stocks are you looking at right now?",

    "content": "Markets hit fresh highs while gold bursts above $4,000—just as autos brace for a **$30B** tariff squeeze. Here’s your quick macro wrap for today (Oct 9, 2025).\n\n[Market snapshot image](https://s3.smartdeer.de/images/genai/mgiylogzuwszfwm38bq.png)\n\n**Highlights:**\n- Equities: Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Dow set new highs; tech and gold led; gold > **$4,000/oz**.\n- FX: Dollar index at a **1.75-month** high; euro and yen fell on political instability and weak data.\n- Autos: US tariffs could cut industry profits by ~**$30B** by 2025; margins down **100–150 bps**.\n- Growth/Policy: Wells Fargo lifts 2025 US GDP to **2.0%**; expects **two more Fed cuts** in H1 2026.\n- Energy: EIA boosts 2025–26 US oil output view to ~**13.5M bpd**; Brent crude **+1.21%**.\n\n*Sentiment snapshot:*\n- 📉 Bearish: Automakers most exposed include Toyota, Volkswagen, GM, Ford, Honda.\n- ⚠️ Uncertainty: Dollar strength tied to France/Japan politics; US shutdown risk and soft jobs add ambiguity.\n- 🚀 Bullish: Tech leadership to records; gold rallies on safe-haven demand.\n- 📈 Bullish: Upgraded US GDP and expected rate cuts support risk assets.\n- ⚖️ Mixed: High US supply keeps oil output strong; price path still uncertain.\n\n**Names in focus:**\n- **GM (GM):** Facing tariff-driven profit headwinds; investing **$4B** to localize US production as margins slip.\n- **Tesla (TSLA):** About **$300M** in added tariff costs on imported components despite US manufacturing base.\n- **Wells Fargo (WFC):** Raises US growth outlook; flags two more Fed cuts, citing resilient consumers and capex.\n- **ExxonMobil (XOM):** Guyana output advancing to **640,000 bpd**; French backing bolsters regional security.\n- **Toyota (7203.T):** Most exposed among global automakers to US tariffs; faces steep profit reductions.\n\n**Why it matters:** Record index levels alongside a surging dollar and gold signal a barbell market—growth and safety both in demand. Tariffs threaten auto margins and capex plans, while expected 2026 rate cuts may cushion valuations for tech and rate-sensitive sectors. Elevated US oil output could temper crude prices, aiding consumers but pressuring producers’ pricing power.\n\nWhere are you positioning next—stick with mega-cap tech and gold, or buy the tariff dip in autos and energy?\n\nFor faster headline alerts and market dashboards: [Download App](https://goto.smartdeer.org/?source=Reddit)",

    "content": "Hey Reddit, when people talk about NXXT blasting through resistance, it's more of a gradual grind. Supply's wearing thin because each hit on old highs leads to better lows, climbing MAs, and snappy recoveries - sellers either show up or bail.\n\nWatch for these: \n\n(1) former highs flipping to supports on dips; \n\n(2) volume surging on climbs and easing on drops; \n\n(3) no sharp lower lows on 10/30-min charts. \n\nWhile that's in play, these runs can keep circling back to highs over a week. Fueling's ramping, microgrid LOIs are gearing for PPAs, campus has 200 MW upside, burn's down $1M/month, and insiders are committed - enough to eye a $3 hold and $4 tries. As of Oct 6, 2025, it's trading around $2.07. What'd flip your view - dropping the 20-MA, big dumps at peaks, or a retest flop?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nMGX IBM CAT PANW CRM NBIS Y BKKT CLSK NKE PFE BQ V A TSSI NB APVO ELPW PLUG HIND PALI BURU ACET AMZN HOOD UPC HYLN NNE ADBE TMO YDKG BOLT CRCL NRXP ASTS STX SPRB DVLT UBER SES MP TLPH BNC GLTO QBTS CLIR CPIX SNDK RYDE RR GNLN NITO COCH METC LWLG SLNH JHX FOFO ANIX QCOM BA CDTX SLRX T SENS SGLY XOM PMAX LXEO SMR CCCX GOOG DELL SHMD AVGO WMT JNJ NVNI NFLX MSTR AMBI NEOV GSRT TLSA INDP AGRZ ACN ABVE MARA NCPL PLTR GPUS MSN AMD CVNA DRMA CLRB CRDO OPEN YYAI SMTK OKLO BNAI HTCO ZNB HTLM JPM BMNR SLGL NEE DKNG UAMY BTM USGO APPS COST",

On \\[NASDAQ\\]: NXXT, supply keeps thinning because every revisit to prior caps ends with higher lows, rising MAs, and quick reclaims. That forces would-be sellers to step up or step aside. Once resistance is thin, small bits of positive news can push price into a fresh discovery range.\n\n\n\nTrack three signals: \n\n(1) prior caps turning into support on retests; \n\n(2) volume expanding on green and cooling on red; \n\n(3) no decisive lower low across the 10/30-minute timeframes. \n\n\n\nWhile those hold - and they have - campaigns tend to revisit highs repeatedly within a week. With fueling expansion live, microgrid LOIs in play, campus optionality, cut burn, and insider alignment, the story can sustain attention long enough to attempt a $3 base and later shots at $4+. What would tell you the process is changing - loss of the 20-MA, heavier distribution at highs, or a failed retest of a prior cap?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLAC NVDA GOOG COIN WDC ELAB CLRB CLIK VTYX PALI WETH ESOA SPRB BLBX TCRT SGLY SCLX MGX AYTU ELPW TAOP MA CTEV NRXP PGEN QUIK LWLG ROLR RYDE TSSI DKNG UPC PRHI CLSK DEVS STX PYXS HUMA MTEN XOM GWAV PCSA POET V NEE BKKT SHMD UAMY SENS NITO MSN PLTR BMNR BURU ZBIO THH SMTK GNLN COST ORBS SLRX PYPL LCFY YDKG F BAC OPEN ULY STEM VRT GPUS META AMZN CRCL NUKK A AIRE NCPL SOPA CCHH INDP OMCC CRM ATRA CAT APVO AMAT REKR QBTS ANIX BJDX CDTX HYLN ANET SLNO JHX TELO DELL ICE FLUT SOFI STAK HTLM LAES BRLT CRWD PMAX MIGI Y ZNB DVLT T ADBE UNH COCH GSRT APLD PFE MP NBIS TMO WHWK BA ACN ORCL VELO AMD AEHR PLUG EGAN CPIX HTCO SNWV POLA GILD ZKIN JPM XBIO NNE GTBP TSLA FOFO NFLX MARA SOUN\n\n\n\n\n\nRKLB RKT LLY TAOP DKNG NRXP SMR VTYX UAMY SOFI YDKG HYLN NVNI HTCO TMO GORV AMD DGNX QNCX QMCO NVDA PYXS JNJ VZ ASTS META AMZN T LPTH TLPH LRCX RGC DELL TTSH MA MLTX MP COIN CHAI CLRB RR COST HIND FPA SHMD A AMBI APP NEOV ICE MRVL RVPH MSN SOUN POET Y ORCL AIRE SNDK METC OKLO ELPW MIGI QBTS ZNB AEHR APPS TTD SENS THH OPTT CRM SNWV SHFS UNH IONQ GWAV ANIX FLUT CVNA TLSA VTSI SOPA GNLN GOOG V PLUG EPSM DEVS NKE NUKK ANET CCCX CLIR YYAI ZKIN TSSI NEE RVSN BTM ROLR RYDE HUMA ZBIO ALMS AYTU SLGL SLRX CCTG NCPL POLA FIG BGL NXXT JHX QUIK SES SCLX NB PMAX IBM VRT ACN BMNR CAT PLTR PFE COCH NITO SGLY ORBS MSTR STAK SLNH CRCL SPRB APVO ATRA BKKT LAR NBIS PGEN OMCC MGX OPEN JPM CLSK CCHH CLIK LAES WHWK P BLBX BRLT PANW ALAB REKR F GSRT INDP VSTM BQ EGAN TELO",

Swing investors, on the other hand, should focus on structure: resistance flipping into support and catalysts that deepen conviction - think PPA conversions, fueling route expansions, EV depot pilot data, and progress on the Florida campus offtake.\n\nConfidence is high for a reason: triple-digit August growth, Fort Myers fueling launch, healthcare microgrid LOIs, a 200 MW campus in play, roughly $1M/month in burn reduction, and a CEO who bought 1,000,000 shares. That’s the kind of mix that keeps bigger players in the game, which explains why dips keep getting bought and resistance zones don’t stick.\n\nIf we see steady acceptance above $2.80–$2.90, a $3 base becomes a natural launchpad. Add a solid catalyst and the range could stretch into the $4s before pausing.

If acceptance builds there and a catalyst lands - like a PPA execution, campus offtake, or marquee fueling-route win - the setup allows a measured range expansion toward $3.50–$4.20 before any real cooldown.\n\nWhy that’s realistic: markets reward transitions from transactional to contracted revenue, and NXXT’s stack (fueling → EV depots → microgrids) fits that evolution. Add triple-digit August growth, a \\~$1M/month burn cut, and insider buying, and the risk/reward profile becomes institution-friendly.

The structure is durable - ascending lows, rising 5/10/20 MAs, and intraday resistance repeatedly turning into support. That pattern usually sustains until either volume blows off at highs or we print a lower low that breaks the rhythm. Neither has appeared yet.\n\n\n\nPotential pause points are psychological and supply-driven: a first tag of $3 often invites digestion; any quick wick into $3.20-$3.50 could pull back to reload. Beyond that, catalysts decide whether we attempt $4-$5 this cycle. The pipeline is there: fueling expansion, healthcare microgrid LOIs converting to PPAs, wireless EV depot pilots, and progress on the \\~200 MW campus. Insider alignment and trimmed burn give patience to larger money. Do you plan to ride the trend with a trailing stop under the 20-MA on 10-minute, or scale out into strength and rebuy flag breaks?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKRRO HYLN PYPL DVLT UPC POET DGNX DELL MTEN AYTU SPRB PHOE ZBIO APLD SNWV MARA RYDE POLA CLRB HUMA CCTG AEHR BRLT DKNG OMCC V HOOD TLPH FOFO UNH AMAT OPTT SHFS SOFI TSLA PRHI RVPH ROLR ELAB PYXS HIND LRCX IONQ GSRT GOOG EAF RGC QCOM ALMS WDC COST XOM MA BNC BA TLSA RR NITO STEM DEVS BTM FIG ZKIN SNDK PMAX NEE OKLO VRT ONMD METC META C NVDA NCPL ICE CRWD WBX ABVE SENS BQ NVNI OPEN BJDX CRM INTC TCRT ALAB GPUS TSSI CVNA JNJ NXXT ORBS LPTH MGX ATRA CCHH BMNR BURU DFLI JHX ANET ORCL ACN SMTK QNCX MSTR APP XBIO ACET PGEN A MRVL",

The chart's all about buyer power - dips are quick and get bought up fast, MAs are spreading out and climbing, old ceilings turning into new supports. That's how real runs build, hitting fresh highs over days, not just a flash.\n\nBuyers got reasons to stick around: the businesses mesh perfectly. Fueling brings in cash and clients, wireless EV charging cashes in on those fleets, microgrids seal long-term deals. Fort Myers rollout, LA healthcare LOIs, Florida campus with 200 MW and data center space - it's a solid growth path. They cut burn by $1M/month, CEO's insider buys show skin in the game. More eyes from big accounts and feeds mean better liquidity too. With August revenue up 222% YoY, if it holds above $2.70s and news drops, you thinking a direct shot to $3.20–$3.50, or a dip reload before pushing to $4?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nDFLI USAR ASTS BOLT FOFO XOM CVNA HTLM ANIX JNJ CRM PMAX COCH VRT COST CCHH RKT CCTG CLRB CRCL WHWK POLA ZBIO METC GSRT QMCO SPRB TSLA CAT APLD MSTR CLSK SLGL SLRX SLNH GOOG UPC MGX DVLT RVSN SLNO AVGO APVO VTYX GTBP PYXS C PCSA UBER TSSI GNLN OMCC DGNX TMO HIND AMBI BNC DKNG CHAI WBX CLIK BGL NRXP ELPW LRCX SOFI RYDE ALMS DRMA QBTS SES NUKK ANET MSN COIN PFE NITO TLSA NBIS T V BRLT MIGI HOOD ROLR REKR BMEA GS PALI SMR VZ EPSM ELAB SOUN MA ULY VTSI Y PRHI GPUS AMAT LXEO ACN CLIR NVNI TLPH BTM GWAV BA MRVL FIG MSFT ABVE NB STAK",

Fort Myers expansion, healthcare LOIs, and the Florida campus plan provide a believable revenue glidepath, while a \\~$1M/month burn reduction and insider buying lower perceived execution risk.

For NXXT, the checklist is simple: maintain higher lows on the 10- and 30-minute charts, hold the $2.54–$2.60 acceptance band, and avoid closing below $2.43.

    "content": "For newcomers who just saw the chart: \\[NASDAQ\\]: NXXT operates three linked businesses - mobile on-site fueling for fleets, smart microgrids that sell power under long-term contracts, and wireless EV depot charging aimed at those same fleets. Near-term cash comes from fueling; multi-year visibility comes from microgrids; EV charging bridges the two. Recent highlights include triple-digit August growth, a new Fort Myers fueling market, healthcare microgrid LOIs, and a Florida campus plan targeting \\~200 MW with data-center acreage.\n\n\n\nThe balance sheet looks cleaner after a reported \\~$1M/month burn reduction, and the CEO bought 1,000,000 shares at $1.67. That alignment plus visible institutions attracted fresh eyes. On the chart, price reclaimed key moving averages, flipped $2.43 to support, and pressed to $2.74 in an “orderly strength” pattern with volume confirmation.\n\n\n\nFrom here, acceptance above the mid-$2.60s and a controlled test of $3 keeps the uptrend intact; failure back below $2.43 would argue for more rebuilding. What proof point would convert you from spectator to participant - technical acceptance above $3 or a signed PPA/tenant update?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nRR INTC RITR HUMA BNAI QUIK NKE VTSI ACN SHFS BURU CDTX PHOE CCHH SNSE PLTR SENS VSTM CRWD BA REKR GWAV MGX COST ZBIO GILD RKT MA ROLR SMR APPS QBTS ALMS NRXP BMEA CLIR ANET WMT NITO DKNG UNH APP NXXT BOLT ORBS IBM TCRT SCLX MSTR WBX CAT POLA MSFT OPEN THH V QNCX TTSH SPHL INDP LXEO ZONE STEM KRRO AVGO GNLN META P PALI CCCX AIRE SLNH PFE XOM USAR JNJ APLD HTLM YDKG SLNO LCFY SNWV DFLI METC EAF A ACET NEE SOUN LWLG RGC HTCO IONQ T QMCO DEVS SGLY BLBX ATRA LAES ICE PLUG SLGL SHMD WETH QCOM TSSI BGL DGNX HYLN TELO GOOG RVSN ASTS AMZN TMO Y POET BNC NVNI LPTH PRHI PMAX STX RYDE AGRZ COCH DELL MP MU WDC STAK SMTK GORV OKLO LAC ANIX VTYX MIGI JHX SLDP VELO DRMA CRM AYTU MTEN NVDA AAREB TLSA CVNA MRVL PYPL SNDK GLTO FIG PCSA BRLT ESOA CLIK OPTT EPSM C AEHR",

    "content": "Yo Reddit, NXXT’s chart is telling a dope story - check the finance card above showing it hit $2.811 today. Sellers tried holding old highs but got smoked as buyers kept defending dips above the 10/20 MAs, stacking higher lows and pulling the MAs up. That’s how resistance gets eaten up. We’re seeing it now with price absorbing supply into $2.74.\n\nNext step? Hold above $2.60s, form a tight flag, and push through $2.80s to test $3. With 222% YoY revenue growth, microgrid LOIs, Florida campus plans, $1M/month burn cuts, and the CEO’s big share buy, there’s fuel for a breakout. If it consolidates quietly under $3 and a catalyst hits, $4+ isn’t wild.

    "content": "Rallies that last usually have a revenue mix that’s trending from transactional to contracted. \\[NASDAQ\\]: NXXT is moving that way. Fueling adds near-term cash and customer relationships; wireless EV depot charging can monetize those relationships further; microgrids under PPAs can lock in multi-year revenue. The Florida campus plan adds scale and a potential anchor tenant dynamic for firm power.\n\n\n\nWhen the market sees that path - and sees cost controls plus insider alignment - it’s more willing to push price into discovery. Today’s print showed that willingness: firm demand above $2.43, a steady reclaim of moving averages, and a decisive trip to $2.74. If catalysts land while we base high (PPAs, offtake, EV pilots, major route wins), you can get range expansion rather than mean reversion.\n\n\n\nExtension candidates often overshoot obvious levels before resting. After a proper base near $3, the next conversation zone becomes $3.50–$4+, contingent on tape character. What combination of technical acceptance and fundamental news would make you hold for that higher zone?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nTAOP VTSI LAR GS CRDO AAREB SNDK FPA SLNO USGO PYXS APPS WBX TMO SOPA MARA SPHL SOFI MTEN PRHI DEVS LLY CPIX DRMA BA TSLA LCFY SLNH NNE HTLM METC TLSA TLPH PCSA TCRT TSSI DVLT ROLR PGEN B AYTU ATRA BLBX JPM BAC OPTT BNC XOM ZBIO PMAX MSTR DELL JHX HTCO ESOA AEHR C ELPW BKNG CHAI SHFS NXXT V RR PLUG WETH LWLG CCCX TTD LAC HYLN GOOG CRWD BMNR SOUN QBTS IBM ULY DKNG PLTR P ACET LRCX BTM AMD ICE NRXP BOLT NEOV AMZN STEM ZONE DGNX SLRX POET BMEA STAK MSFT AIRE STX ANET GSRT ACN SGLY NUKK MSN GILD NVDA CLIK AMAT APLD WMT IONQ VRT LAES",

I only play on my playstation 5 right now and have seen that mini led and oled are pretty up there, these are 2 models ive been looking at, the only thing that scares me with oleds is ive heard the burn is bad and that text is usually pretty  bad as well.\n\nIm lookin for monitors at around 300-500(ik the oled is 600) so if you guys have any recs.

Users, upon signing into Finviz, are welcomed by a dashboard that provides a snapshot of the day's market trends, top-performing stocks, recent news, and significant insider trading actions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Finviz Application Availability:**\n\nCurrently, Finviz does not offer an application for download from either the Android Play Store or the Apple Store. It is advised to access Finviz through conventional web browsers on computers or tablets.\n\n People might mistakenly install the FINWIZ app, but it is not the same company. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Insights into Finviz Heatmaps:**\n\nFinviz's heatmaps offer a dynamic visualization of the US and global stock market performances, pinpointing potential trading opportunities. The platform's ability to compile and display a comprehensive heatmap with such rapidity is noteworthy.

Nonetheless, Finviz stands out by allowing screenings based on candlestick and chart patterns, catering to both investors and traders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wcr435x9r6zb1.jpg?width=1273&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e25c16c31a965de1d9cb606aa9cb96c393548914\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Analysis of Finviz Charting:**\n\nFinviz provides essential daily chart pattern recognition and a select number of overlays and indicators, differentiating it from platforms like MetaStock and TradingView. The inclusion of automatic trendline detection and pattern identification offers significant advantages for traders focused on patterns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Enhancements in Finviz Elite Charting:**\n\nThe continuous development of Finviz Elite has resulted in notable improvements to interactive charting, including the addition of Heiken Ashi charts and more indicators and overlays. The new auto-save feature for charts and annotations further enhances the user experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/alyszlpcr6zb1.jpg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d40e73209dbfce747ef92d7ee3b770532132590c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Guide to Building Backtests in Finviz:**\n\nFinviz's backtester is a powerful tool with over 100 indicators, offering automated chart pattern recognition to aid in creating distinctive trading systems. An example of its effectiveness is a system that outperformed the S&P 500 over a 25-year period, utilizing the Price Rate of Change indicator.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tips for Stock Discovery Using Finviz:**\n\nTo identify potential breakout stocks, users can apply specific screener filters like \"Price crossed MA50 above\" and \"Gap Up 5%.\" \n\nFor locating potential short-squeeze candidates, filters like \"Float Short Over 30%\" and \"Option/Short - Optionable\" are useful. \n\nHowever, Finviz does not directly offer tools for finding undervalued stocks; for such a feature, platforms like Stock Rover are recommended, which provide detailed criteria including Fair Value and Margin of Safety for value-seeking investors.",

    "content": "# Summary \n\nThe UP World LNG Shipping Index (UPI) fell by 2.18% to 166.89 points, dropping below the 170-point threshold for the first time in months. The decline was mainly driven by a sharp pullback in Japanese carriers, with Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, “K” Line, and NYK Line all decreasing between 5% and 7%. Oil majors BP and Chevron also weakened by around 4%, which weighed on sentiment.\n\nDespite the correction, several stocks showed resilience. New Fortress Energy recovered 16.6%, regaining early-September levels, while ADNOC L&S hit a new all-time high with a 4.15% increase. Cool Company continued to edge closer to its buyout price, while Excelerate Energy attempted to rekindle its upward trend.\n\nOverall, the UPI’s decline signals the end of late-summer momentum and a return to its broader trading range. Nonetheless, underlying support remains robust, supported by long-term fundamentals for LNG shipping — demand growth, fleet renewal, and new terminal capacity — which keep the outlook positive.\n\n# UPI & SPX \n\nThe UP World LNG Shipping Index, which tracks listed LNG shipping companies, lost 3.73 points (2.18%), closing at 166.89 points, while the S&P 500 index gained 1.09%. The chart below illustrates the performance of both indices with weekly data.\n\n[Week 40-2025: Chart of the UP World LNG Shipping Index with S&P 500 \\(Source: UP-Indices\\)](https://preview.redd.it/bku6wspsfptf1.png?width=1876&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0fad4b3d2993c00d7c072bc25e74fc69425a12)\n\n# Broader View\n\nThe UPI dropped below 170 points, signalling the end of growth. Similar to some constituents, the UPI returned to a sideways trading range. The sharp decline of Japanese companies, which lost around six per cent, had a significant impact.\n\nThe weakening of other companies does not seem severe and might be due to a correction of previous growth, a rebound to support levels, or a sideways trend. Trading volume was significantly below average, partly because of the Chinese holidays.\n\n# Constituents\n\nThe correction of previous growth within the uptrend is also evident in the case of the most weakened company, Awilco LNG (OSE: ALNG). It lost 9.6%, but still maintains a growing trend. \n\nNext are three Japanese companies. The most notable decline was observed in Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (TSE: 9104), although it did not experience the largest loss among the companies. However, after a 6.4% drop, it broke through its support level and reached the 4,330 yen mark. If the decline continues, the 4,196-4,330 yen gap will close, a level below which the price has not been seen since its inception in December 2023. K Line (TSE: 9107) fell 7.7%, but this merely ended its growth spurt, and the price has now returned to a sideways trend. NYK Line (TSE: 9101) fared similarly, losing 5.3%. Its attempt at growth appeared the most serious, but it was halted and reversed within three weeks.\n\nNext in line in terms of losses were BP (NYSE: BP) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX), which fell by 4.3% and 4.1%, respectively. Both are engaged in a tug-of-war over the continuation of their sluggish growth. The forces are evenly matched, resulting in sideways movement.\n\nCapital Clean Energy Carriers (NYQ CCEC) is establishing a new price level between its current value and the one achieved last year, driven by summer growth. A loss of 3.7 per cent, combined with the pattern over the previous two weeks, suggests that the rally remains challenging, but nobody appears willing to decline.\n\nFinally, Golar LNG (NYQ: GLNG) completes the list of notable declines. GLNG dropped 3.2% and remains at the support level after its previous attempt at growth in August was rejected. \n\nTsakos Energy Navigation (NYSE: TEN) is experiencing a slowdown in growth. The decline of 2.8% was more pronounced during the week, but was offset.\n\nDynagas LNG Partners (NYSE: DLNG) dropped 2.2%, but it only hit the support level. \n\nRegarding growing companies, New Fortress Energy (NYQ: NFE) once again recorded the highest gains, and it was the only company to experience a double-digit increase. With a 16.6% rise, it regained its pre-slump levels in early September.\n\nTo paraphrase a saying, there is often nothing for an extended period until Adnoc L&S (ADX: ADNOCLS) rises with a 4.15% increase. However, this is a significant jump, as it is dominantly reaching new historical highs. \n\nCool Company (NYSE/OSE: CLCO) continued to strengthen marginally, nearing the announced buyback price, with a growth rate of 3.24%.\n\nExcelerate Energy (NYQ: EE) showed growth of ‘only’ 2.29%, but this is moving beyond the previous range and marks an attempt at a new uptrend.\n\nMISC (KLSE: 3816) recovered from its earlier decline below support by returning to it, rising by 1.4%.\n\nFlex LNG (NYSE: FLNG) is trying to resume growth, which was halted by dividend payments, adding 1.3% last week.\n\n# Crystal Ball\n\nThe late-summer rise was rejected, and UPI returned to the previous range. This area provides strong support.\n\nOur outlook remains steadfastly positive in the long term. The burgeoning demand for LNG, bolstered by situational or management-driven actions and the potential for new long-term contracts, paints a promising picture. Investors should watch policy developments, market competition, and upcoming corporate earnings for further direction.\n\n# About UPI\n\nEstablished in 2020, the UP World LNG Shipping Index is a rules-based stock index family designed to measure the performance of publicly traded companies worldwide involved in the maritime transportation of liquefied natural gas (LNG). This unique index covers 21 companies and partnerships worldwide, representing over 65% of the world's LNG carrier fleet in 2020. The UP Index offers premium services with freemium and trial access to charts. With Freemium, users can access the basic UPI vs. S&P 500 chart after completing an email registration. The trial includes full access for fourteen days.\n\n# Final Note\n\nThis report primarily relies on technical analysis using weekly data.\n\nSource: [https://lngshippingstocks.com/upi-falls-below-170-points/](https://lngshippingstocks.com/upi-falls-below-170-points/)",

Here’s what’s moving markets on Oct 4, 2025.\n\n**Highlights:**\n- **GOOG**: Commits $4B to a new Arkansas data center, boosting local jobs and cloud/AI capacity.\n- **BA**: Delays 777X entry to 2027; expects a $2.5–$4B charge; ramps contingency hiring amid an ongoing St. Louis strike.\n- **CVX**: Major fire at the El Segundo refinery threatens California fuel supplies, likely lifting regional gas prices; safety probes underway.\n- **XOM** (and peers incl. Chevron, BP): Announce significant job cuts after oil price declines and recent M&A; ExxonMobil trimming about 2,000 roles and facing EU sustainability-rule headwinds.\n- **TSLA** (with GM): Leads a **record** US EV quarter, topping 438,000 units and ~10.5% market share *as federal incentives expire*.\n\n> Sentiment: 🚀 Google bullish | 📉 Boeing bearish | ⚠️ Refinery risk | 🔻 Oil majors strongly bearish | 📈 EVs bullish\n\nWhy it matters: AI/data-center capex looks resilient; aerospace program slippage extends execution and certification risk; a California refinery outage can ripple into pump prices given tight regional supply; supermajors are leaning into cost discipline and post-merger integration; EV demand appears durable even as incentives roll off.\n\nBackground: A double-digit US EV market share marks a structural shift in autos, while refinery incidents have historically driven short, sharp price spikes in California due to specific fuel blends and limited import flexibility.\n\nWhich headline do you think will matter most for Q4 positioning—GOOG’s capex, BA’s delay, CVX/XOM’s cuts, or TSLA/GM’s demand?

The last update was Oct 1, meaning today’s nonfarm payrolls report won’t be released until the shutdown ends.\n* Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said the US economy is “still in pretty good shape” heading into 2026, with government spending and “all of the AI infrastructure build” driving growth despite tariffs and a softer labor market. \n* PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE’S CONSIDERING TAXPAYER REBATES OF $1,000 TO $2,000 FUNDED BY TARIFF REVENUES — Bloomberg\n\nMAG7:\n\n* AAPL - Jefferies downgrades to Underperform from Hold, lowers PT to 205.16 from 205.82. Our muted outlook for FY2026/2027 is driven by: 1) a $100 price hike for iPhone 18 Pro/Pro Max, and 2) a cautious outlook for iPhone 18 Fold (12.5 million units). We estimate the current stock price factors in more than 2x that every year.\n* TSLA - NEW CAR SALES IN BRITAIN UP 0.11% YEAR-ON-YEAR TO 8,038 UNITS IN SEPT- NEW AUTOMOTIVE DATA\n* AMZN - Goldman Sachs raises PT to 275 from 240. Maintains Buy rating. Ahead of Q3 earnings season and against the current backdrop of investor sentiment, positioning, and debates, we highlight Amazon as a preferred name among our large cap coverage. In this note, we frame the key investor debates around its AWS segment and the compounding tailwinds in its Advertising segment.  GOOGL - Google will invest $4B to build a data center on 1,000+ acres in West Memphis, its first in the state, creating thousands of jobs. It also launched a $25M Energy Impact Fund for local efficiency projects and workforce development.\n* NVDA's multibillion-dollar AI chip deal with the U.A.E., announced in May, is still on hold nearly five months later. \n\n\n\nOTHER COMPANIES:\n\n* RCAT - Needham initiates coverage with Buy rating, PT of 17. We believe the unmanned aerial systems industry is entering a multi-year supercycle and view Red Cat as uniquely positioned to capture accelerating demand for defense-grade small intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance drones. We see multi-year tailwinds from SRR2, accelerating domestic and international defense spend, and new domain expansion driving significant growth.\"\n* WMT - Walmart-backed fintech OnePay will add bitcoin and ether trading and custody to its app later this year with help from Zerohash, CNBC reports. \n* SNOW - Jefferies reiterates buy rating on SNOW, PT 270. Snowflake remains one of our favorite data and artificial intelligence stories and stands to benefit meaningfully as enterprise AI strategies mature and AI-driven data volumes grow exponentially in the coming years. Buy, $270 price target.\n* VSCO - Jefferies raises PT To 35 from 30, rates it as a buy. The Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show has proved to be both a cultural and commercial engine. With the show upcoming, we provide a playbook on how the event could help drive near-term results. Outlined below are share-gaining opportunities to build a case for the show’s impact and how strong execution points to near-term upside.\n* TKO - Guggenheim lifted its PT to 225 from 205, reiterating buy. the raise reflects “a strong WWE live events slate, including the last-minute addition of WrestlePalooza and a strong, two-night SummerSlam,” plus ESPN rights pull-forward and sponsorship momentum. Full-year adj. OIBDA outlook of $1.615B remains above consensus and guidance.\n* CVX - A major fire has erupted after an explosion at Chevron's El Segundo refinery near LAX. The facility supplies \\~20% of SoCal’s gasoline and 40% of its jet fuel. Officials say no elevated toxins detected yet, but residents are urged to keep windows closed as smoke spreads\n* TSMC - Huawei used TSMC components in top AI chips. \n* RDDT - Citizens reiterated outperform with a PT of 200. saying logged-in U.S. users monetize at 10x+ the rate of logged-out users. He sees SEO noise as less relevant than the strong momentum in Reddit’s ad business, which he expects to drive earnings upside.\n* AMAT - warned it expects a $710M revenue hit from the new U.S. export restrictions, with $110M shaved off its Q4 and another \\~$600M impact in FY26, per WSJ. \n* OXY - HSBC upgrades to Buy from Hold, raises PT to 55 from 48. based on revised earnings estimates and DCF assumptions. Our DCF-based TP of USD55.00 is equivalent to 6.7x our revised 2026 EBITDA estimate (down from 6.9x previously) and is slightly more than a turn above the historical level of 5.6x.\n* PYPL - Wolfe Research downgrades to peer perform from outperform: questions remain on the company's ability to drive an acceleration in branded growth, which remains top of mind for investors given its indications of market share dynamics and weight within gross profit. Although we believe PYPL's new initiatives have the potential to drive higher branded growth, the year-end acceleration and medium-term guidance remain a show-me story in our view.\n* BMBL - Godlamn downgrades to neutral from buy, lowers PT to 7 from 8. n terms of current industry trends, we leverage third-party data and arrive at the following takeaways: 1) while Hinge continues to outperform other apps in terms of user growth, US user trends have decelerated throughout the quarter; 2) Tinder has started to see an improvement in user trends internationally; and 3) consistent with management messaging, Bumble is continuing to de-emphasize marketing, especially in the US, which has led to downloads declining 35%+ year over year (albeit with US MAUs declining at a slower rate).\n* CART - Piper Sandler downgrades to Neutral from Overweight, Lowers PT to 41 from 62. We move to the sidelines on CART in light of competitive pressures over the last month. We're less concerned about the quarter than an industry dynamic that pits CART against scaled competitors that may be cheaper and fast-growing peers forging new partnerships. At \\~10% GTV growth YTD, the topline looks vulnerable and we downgrade to Neutral.\n* FCX - UBS upgrades to buy from neutral, PT to 48 from 42.50. We have consulted various mining experts and they see the risk of a structural impairment to Grasberg's production/value as low, with water challenges relatively easier to resolve at Grasberg (up a mountain) versus many underground mines. We believe the market is pricing in an overly pessimistic outcome for Grasberg recovery, therefore see the risk versus reward as attractive.\n* RUM - announced a partnership with Perplexity to integrate its AI search tech into Rumble, launch a bundled Rumble Premium + Perplexity Pro subscription, and promote Perplexity’s Comet browser to Rumble’s audience.\n* COIN - Coinbase upgraded to Buy from Neutral at Rothschild & Co Redburn PT $417, up from $325.\n\nOTHER NEWS:\n\n* S&P 500 earnings growth has been hovering in a robust range around 11% for nearly two years. Will the Q3 earnings season continue the trend? The macro backdrop is favorable, in our view, with recent data pointing to solid growth in Q3 (Deutsche Bank forecasts U.S. GDP growth at 2.8% while tracking estimates are pushing nearly 4%), the dollar turning from a headwind to a tailwind, a diminishing drag from falling oil prices, and continued strength for the secular growth sectors.\n\n",

    "content": "MAJOR NEWS:\n\n* Government shutdown enters the third day. \n* BLS confirms its website won’t be updated until the federal government reopens. The last update was Oct 1, meaning today’s nonfarm payrolls report won’t be released until the shutdown ends.\n* Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said the US economy is “still in pretty good shape” heading into 2026, with government spending and “all of the AI infrastructure build” driving growth despite tariffs and a softer labor market. \n* PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE’S CONSIDERING TAXPAYER REBATES OF $1,000 TO $2,000 FUNDED BY TARIFF REVENUES — Bloomberg\n\nMAG7:\n\n* AAPL - Jefferies downgrades to Underperform from Hold, lowers PT to 205.16 from 205.82. Our muted outlook for FY2026/2027 is driven by: 1) a $100 price hike for iPhone 18 Pro/Pro Max, and 2) a cautious outlook for iPhone 18 Fold (12.5 million units). We estimate the current stock price factors in more than 2x that every year.\n* TSLA - NEW CAR SALES IN BRITAIN UP 0.11% YEAR-ON-YEAR TO 8,038 UNITS IN SEPT- NEW AUTOMOTIVE DATA\n* AMZN - Goldman Sachs raises PT to 275 from 240. Maintains Buy rating. Ahead of Q3 earnings season and against the current backdrop of investor sentiment, positioning, and debates, we highlight Amazon as a preferred name among our large cap coverage. In this note, we frame the key investor debates around its AWS segment and the compounding tailwinds in its Advertising segment.  GOOGL - Google will invest $4B to build a data center on 1,000+ acres in West Memphis, its first in the state, creating thousands of jobs. It also launched a $25M Energy Impact Fund for local efficiency projects and workforce development.\n* NVDA's multibillion-dollar AI chip deal with the U.A.E., announced in May, is still on hold nearly five months later. \n\n\n\nOTHER COMPANIES:\n\n* RCAT - Needham initiates coverage with Buy rating, PT of 17. We believe the unmanned aerial systems industry is entering a multi-year supercycle and view Red Cat as uniquely positioned to capture accelerating demand for defense-grade small intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance drones. We see multi-year tailwinds from SRR2, accelerating domestic and international defense spend, and new domain expansion driving significant growth.\"\n* WMT - Walmart-backed fintech OnePay will add bitcoin and ether trading and custody to its app later this year with help from Zerohash, CNBC reports. \n* SNOW - Jefferies reiterates buy rating on SNOW, PT 270. Snowflake remains one of our favorite data and artificial intelligence stories and stands to benefit meaningfully as enterprise AI strategies mature and AI-driven data volumes grow exponentially in the coming years. Buy, $270 price target.\n* VSCO - Jefferies raises PT To 35 from 30, rates it as a buy. The Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show has proved to be both a cultural and commercial engine. With the show upcoming, we provide a playbook on how the event could help drive near-term results. Outlined below are share-gaining opportunities to build a case for the show’s impact and how strong execution points to near-term upside.\n* TKO - Guggenheim lifted its PT to 225 from 205, reiterating buy. the raise reflects “a strong WWE live events slate, including the last-minute addition of WrestlePalooza and a strong, two-night SummerSlam,” plus ESPN rights pull-forward and sponsorship momentum.

I’m mainly looking at etf’s and maybe dividends to try and diversify my portfolio in the long term though Id like to have a small percentage of my portfolio as play money to try and catch some good wins on individual stocks though I know this is risky and unlikely to pay off but soon I’ll have built up my emergency fund and have cleared any debts so I’ll have a fair bit of cash to invest in each month(for now it’s just been bits and pieces I’ve had left over) I’ve invested mainly in the vanguard S&P 500 but have just looked into a dividend pie I found and liked the look of trading 212.\n\nI do have about £1000 in crypto that I made from about 400 that I might look to sell and put into stocks as even though I don’t know much about stocks I know even less about crypto lol\n\nPlease don’t rinse me too much I’m new and trying to figure out my action plan regarding investing for the next few decades!

I typically eat a protein heavy, whole food diet... primary protein sources are black beans, chicken, turkey and some weeks I eat red meat once or twice. I eat roughly 17-20g of fiber per day (half a cup of All Bran buds and a few fruits and veggies per day). \n\nI started getting Dr memos about LDL in 2020.... Here are my past years results on LDL:\n\n2020 - 116\n\n2021 - 68\n\n2022 - 120\n\n2023 - 118\n\n2024 - 89\n\n2025 - 126\n\nI am a bit lost what to do... The reason why my 2024 result was so low is because I really started focusing on getting more fiber in my diet and I also upped my cardio workouts. \n\nThe only difference that I can think of between 2024 and 2025 is that I have decreased cardio workouts and started lifting more weights. But would an increase of over 40% be just cardio? \n\nI want to think that I eat pretty healthy, exercise and limit alcohol intake to just 2-4 servings per week.\n\nSome other values: \n\nHDL - 56 down from 60.\n\nTri - 110 up from 91. \n\nTotal - 204 up from 167\n\nI measure my BP almost every morning after waking up and I average 118/73 the last year or so.\n\nMy resting heart rate is about 45 per my Garmin watch. \n\nI just don't know what to try next...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, so I’m doing a deep dive into why my cardiologist might’ve decided diltiazem is a good medication for me and I’m wondering if you folks could share your own experiences and knowledge. \n\nContext: I’m in Queensland, Australia. I was diagnosed with POTS on August 12th this year with a tilt test (which was much different than I expected) and during the test my blood pressure was high (190/120) - I was also very nervous about them telling me it’s all in my head. Before the test, I had been put on Propranolol 10mg for a month, then atenolol 60mg for a month. Immediately after the tilt test, I had a consultation with my cardiologist. She confirmed my diagnosis and was a little concerned about my bp but when she took my bp again, it was much lower (130/100 or something similar). Either way, she prescribed me with Cardizem (60mg 3 times a day) which was apparently meant to bring my heart rate down which is, ya know… the main issue I’m there for. She also told me to keep my water and salt intake up.\n\nAfter a month and a bit on that medication, my next appointment came around and I mentioned that the cardizem did nothing and I also had varicose veins and a LOT of weight gain which my mum suggested could’ve been fluid retention. Her solution? Increasing my dose of diltiazem to 240mg once daily, saying I “should definitely see a drop in heart rate” and that I should….. decrease my water and salt intake to fix the water retention… rhe issue being that I was not even drinking enough water already. I’m about 2/3 of the way through the new meds and I just keep gaining more water weight, there has been no change to my heart rate OR blood pressure for that matter, I’m covered in dark stretch marks because of how quickly I gained the weight and I feel heavier and heavier every day. My next appointment is mid December and I don’t know if I should book in earlier with her at the risk of being told off for not sticking with the new dose for long enough for it to “work” or if I ride out the next couple months at the risk of gaining even more weight and dealing with whatever other risks she hasn’t told me about. \n\nI guess my question is: does anyone else have experience with diltiazem? Any suggestions on what I should do? ",

Now I've to upgrade cars of upper three class and they are mostly on Epic 4/5 or Rare 4/5 Stars as earned from Events and, there are few cars with no Events and Campaigns kinda. To upgrade them I need so much of Scrap Scores because it's not worth it to me to go upgrade cars at Epic rank as they will take so much kits and materials plus cash and then do that again to Legendary and Black parts.\n\nIf anyone has any tips regarding Scrap Scores Farming pls pin or comment below and tell me if any Event I've completed or I should complete in order to replay the Event to earn more BP and Scrap Scores? And yes also, if CAN I PLAY THE SAME REPLAYABLE VE/SE AND YET GET SCRAP SCORES?\n\nMention below the Events, Tips, Strategy that I should follow because first three Class of cars, don't matter to me anymore but the concern of all players, the top three Class Cars are the only concerning ones to me🫠",

On Sunday she wasn't interested in her rat which  was odd because shes never rejected food, even during shed. I noticed some darker red/pink spots on her belly and consulted her rescue and foster, they suggested letting her enclosure dry up a bit (I used coconut chip blocks but wasnt able to dry them out enough before putting them in her enclosure a while back) and that helped and it went away, but I notice what appears to be smudges on her eyes and her belly has a very minor pink hue. Is this a shedding sign? I restarted her humidifier (on low and a hygrostat to not overdo it), and poured water into the enclosure corners and covered it up along with sprinking the moss with a tiny bit of water and spraying Zilla humidity spray. Any advice? Thank you!",

    "content": "For context I’ve worked at AMR contra costa county for 2 years, I recently moved to San Diego and applied for the AMR out here. During the first interview I went they require you to take a San Diego protocol test and after that they have you do a medical/trauma assessment on a manakin. The protocol test was whatever but the medical test they have you sit in a room alone with one person and a manakin. I was given a chest pain scenario she had stated before hand due to me having experience working in 911 to just do my assessment how would do it in the field. I completed my assessment and had the said “pt” upgraded to paramedics after assisting with aspirin and nitro. Pts bp and heart rate were fine and the pt was sitting at 94 percent. When the test was over she had told me I failed due to not stating that the airway was clear and that in San Diego county they want sp02 to be at least a 98%. I told her I deemed the airway clear by the patient talking to me. She said she understood and that’s how she would do it in the field as well but insisted that I failed and had to reschedule. I rescheduled again and came to do my medical assessment. This time it was a different worker who had given me an anaphylactic scenario the pt who had no idea what happened and had warm pale skin  but was allergic to bees. After stating twice if the airway was clear and asking what the vitals were she stated that the bp was stable and sp02 was 90. After I remembered the last interview told me SD protocol they wanted a 98% I told her I’d put the pt on a nasal cannula to raise it and it got to 98%  then I asked if the pt had pain so that I could assess if they were stung which she stated no. I got vitals and informed I was going to call for ALS and give the pt epinephrine and reassess vitals every 5 minutes until the medic gets on scene. After she told me that I did the assessment right but told me that she would’ve like if I did the full assessment on the manakin and that she wouldn’t have given oxygen due to the pt being at 90%? due to that I have to reschedule my interview. I couldn’t believe it.",

    "content": "As the new Battle Pass rolls around, I realize the discounted Furies III wasn't permanent and now I'm at a 20 token deficit and pretty annoyed with myself since I wanted to fully upgrade Estella. Likewise, as I look at the new 4x Furies III being sold at 60 tokens each, it also made me realize that upgrading old BP exotics is going to be a nightmare.\n\nIf you're f2p, you get 10 tokens per BP, and therefore it'll take you 6 BPs to buy one single old exotic. If you pay 5 bucks for the premium BP, you get 30 tokens, and it'll take you 2 BPs for one exotic. If you pay 10 bucks for the premium BP plus, you can buy one old exotic per BP. You need 3 exotics for a full upgrade, 4 exotics if you're a new player and missed the battle pass entirely.\nThis is ameliorated by the Black Market 10x Weapon Token for 50k black market coins, so I'm not going to say a new f2p player can only max out one old BP exotic they missed every 2 years (though it seems like it can certainly take that long in the very worst case scenario). I am not sure how often this product refreshes and the rate at which you get black market coins so I can't give a specific timeframe. However, if you spend all your black market coins on these tokens, you're forsaking other exotic upgrade materials. \n\nThese BP exotics, so far, don't seem to be inherently better than regular exotics but are, by comparison, excessively resource and time gated. Naturally, you don't need every single exotic at full power. You might argue that, this being a gacha, such a result is to be expected.\n\nEven so, as a f2p, you're looking at a potentially year-long commitment to bring a single BP exotic up to the same power level as a normal exotic. A current paying player will already need to pick and choose which BP exotics to upgrade and which ones to ignore due to this weapon token economy. And this is all assuming you never miss a BP. A new player one year from now will see themselves effectively barred from a huge chunk of exotics, even if they pay every month for the premium plus BP.\n\nWe also don't know how future exotics will be handled. It's possible BP exotics will outpace new strike/raid ones and eventually we end up with a completely unsustainable exotic upgrading economy. It's also possible this pace of one new exotic per BP will not be a constant and we get BPs with repeat exotics. It's possible we're never going to see a new raid/strike exotic and all new exotics will be BP ones, though I find that doubtful. And it's also possible we'll be given other venues for acquiring BP weapon tokens.\n\nRegardless, as things currently stand, and maybe from your experience with past NetEase games, what are your thoughts on this current BP exotic system?",

Blue Moon also seems very likely for SAG here. It's transformative; he's playing a real-life figure. Seems very SAG-baity. I think White is safe with SAG due to biopic performances doing well there. My top 2 are Chalamet and DiCaprio. DiCaprio is in(likely) the stronger movie, but from what I'm reading, Chalamet is in his film more. DiCaprio has to share the spotlight with a lot of other performances here. Chalamet doing the fast-talking, yelling, and nearly manic delivery that Safdie films require will yield a more showy performance. \n\n  \n**Best Actress** \n\n1. Jessie Buckley for Hamnet(WINNER) \n\n2. Renate Reinsve for Sentimental Value \n\n3. Cynthia Erivo for Wicked for Good \n\n4. Chase Infinti for One Battle After Another \n\n5. Kate Hudson for Song Sung Blue \n\n  \nNotes: I think this is the one race where its going to be a clean sweep. I don't see anyone beating Buckley here. I think Reinsve still happens at SAG despite SAG not being prone to nominating foreign film performances. I think Infiniti definitely makes it in here off the power of the love of OBAA amongst domestic voters. I'm not quite sure how she's going to fair with the international voting bodies. I also think Hudson is going to be a SAG play, and the Best Actress field for SAG is weak enough for her to get in. \n\n  \n**Best Supporting Actor** \n\n1. Sean Penn for One Battle After Another(WINNER) \n\n2. Stellan Skarsgaard for Sentimental Value \n\n3. Paul Mescal for Hamnet \n\n4. Jeremy Strong for Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere \n\n5. Adam Sandler for Jay Kelly \n\nNotes: I'm not 100% sold that Penn is winning everything this season. I think it depends if he actually goes out and campaigns for it. If he does, I think he beats Skarsgaard because it's a more showy performance in what is looking like the BP frontrunner. I feel even if Penn doesn't campaign, he is at least winning SAG here. I think SAG is going to go bananas over OBAA. I think Strong and Sandler are a package deal with the costars(White and Clooney). \n\n  \n**Best Supporting Actress** \n\n1. Teyana Taylor for One Battle After Another(WINNER) \n\n2. Ariana Grande for Wicked for Good \n\n3. Amy Madigan for Weapons \n\n4. Gwyneth Palthrow for Marty Supreme \n\n5. Odessa Azion for Marty Supreme \n\n  \nNotes: I think Taylor and Grande are going to be trading awards at different award shows. I feel like this will be a close race, but I have Taylor edging out Grande for the SAG. I'm just expecting overall chaos with this category all season long. I got Madigan getting in here as well due to how barren this category is. Especially since I'm thinking the SV women are going to be ignored in this category for SAG. I do question Warner Bros ability to juggle all of these campaigns. I just wonder if they're going to be able to handle pushing OBAA, Sinners, and Amy Madigan. I also think both  Palthrow and Azion get in for this SAG, but I expect only one to make it come Oscar morning. \n\n  \n**SAG Ensemble** \n\n1. One Battle After Another(WINNER) \n\n2. Sinners \n\n3. Wicked For Good \n\n4. Marty Supreme \n\n5. Hamnet\n\nNotes: This feels like a done deal to me. I would maybe be more open to Sinners if another distributor is campaigning Sinners, but I fully expect WB to put all of their baskets in the OBAA basket. Wicked For Good gets nominated again this year. I feel more confident that Marty Supreme getting in. Even the small  bit role from Tyler the Creator is getting praise and notices from critics thus far.  \n\n  \n**Stunt Ensemble** \n\n1. Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning(WINNER) \n\n2. Wicked For Good \n\n3. Avatar Fire and Ash \n\n4. Superman \n\n5. One Battle After Another \n\nNotes: Mission Impossible is pretty much a shoe-in for this everytime it releases. I think this is locked even more since it's expected to be the last installment. ",

    "content": "Hey y'all I'm about 4 months into weakness and other UMN symptoms and more than 1 year into twitching and progressive muscle loss everywhere. Here's my 1st post regarding my 1st EMG if you're interested: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ALSorNOT/comments/1mztrt0/1st\\_emg/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ALSorNOT/comments/1mztrt0/1st_emg/)\n\nWell obviously like most of you in here, I tried to trust the EMG and move on but my symptoms have progressed further. My progression has been ultra fast and slow at the same time. Weakness started in left arm and spread to neck/bulbar in 1.5 weeks, then started getting MORE respiratory issues 1 week later, (I already have respiratory issues from long covid/dysautonomia, but it was getting worse like I couldn't exhale the oxygen out of my body as strong), then left leg started to feel stiff and ankles felt wobbly one week after that, and lastly my right hand and arm has been affected one week after that. I know it seems like its post viral or immune mediated just given how rapid the symptoms came on and progressed but unfortunately I was not sick at all when this occurred and its been steadily getting worse everyday without even getting slightly better which makes immune mediated unlikely to me.\n\nI had my 2nd EMG about 1.5 months ago. This was also done by a different neuro at a different place and they did a full body EMG this time. It was both upper and lower limbs with about 12-15 muscles tested throughout. I think they did a few near and on my calves and a few in quads. Also did FDI area, forearm, bicep, and tricep on both arms. Result came back 100% normal again. No chronic denervation, no reinnervation, no fasiculations, all MUAPs normal and in range (i think it was 6?). Basically 2nd neuro also said this doesn't seem like a neurological issue but rather an immune related issue. I do have a pretty rare immune disorder that developed after covid related to eosinophils but that seems like a longshot for all my issues. Rather to me is seems like my immune related issues/disorders eventually caused ALS.\n\nJust to recap here are my symptoms:\n\n* tremors everywhere when activated (leaning against a muscle, extending fingers out, holding neck up from the floor, squatting (quads shake like crazy), arms shakes like crazy when flexing, etc. Basically any position that requires me to hold any part of my muscle steady leads to tremors and shaking like its unsteady due to muscle loss.\n* Twitching: During the 9+ months where I just had twitching and loss of muscle but no weakness, my twitches were like pops that would come and go throughout the day. it occurred everyday and was widespread but it felt like just little pops here and there. Now, the twitching is are like little ripples. I still do get the pops and it occurs randomly throughout the body but now its much more noticeable bothersome just due to how much they shake. My toes especially twitch so much when laying down on both sides and it cause the big toe to move and shake on its own like its contracting. Also getting facial/tongue twitches that I never had during my 9+ months of only twitching.\n* Bulbar: No noticeable slurring to others but I do bite my tongue often when i speak, seem like back of tongue is weak and can't push down food as hard as it used to, tight feeling under the chin when i swallow, nasal regurgitation where food and liquid both seem like its going up there but never full does if that makes sense? Even when im not eating or drinking anything, it seems like my saliva and mucus is just stuck up there and its so bothersome. Certain words begin to tire out if i'm speaking too much. Slightly deviated uvula to the left but all neuros didn't seem concerned. Swallowing is difficult for things like bread crumbs and other small sticky foods like jelly. have to swallow it muscle times or eat/drink something else to push it down.\n* Body: Left arm and right arm both feel weaker than normal, both hands and fingers are very stiff and feel like a rubber band is holding them together. Left leg and right leg quads both very stiff. Left ankle feels like its floppy but can still heel and toe walk (even toe jump). Torso feels weaker as its getting harder to get up from a laid position (but it might also be because I gained 30lbs in weight in one year), left quad feels weak but both quads shake when going down stairs, neck feels stiff when moving it around and heavy and often get neck spasms where im just sitting still and suddenly i'll jolt my neck (very minimal, no one notices).\n* Atrophy: I noticed that i was losing muscle mass everywhere in my body for months before any weakness. Both arms were getting skinnier, knees on both legs became super boney. Well this def sped up as the weakness began to start as now I feel like my wrists are smaller than my wifes. there is atrophy everywhere in my body including back, neck, both arms, trunk, both legs, feet, and even my buttocks. it hurts to put any type of joint on a desk or hard surface now because of how pointy my muscles have gotten due to the lack of muscle mass. My facial muscles also seem to have decreased in mass including my cheeks and jaw.\n* UMN Symptoms: I saw a fellow on here who got diagnosed at a young age as well and he had UMN dominant ALS. Well thats the only logical conclusion I've been able to come to as I have very heavy UMN symptoms. I have very brisk reflexes on all four limbs. Its the point where even if my dog grazes his fur against my left leg, it feels like my nerves are gonna jump out and i feel super jumpy. Neuros did note brisk reflexes but said its not pathological because its diffuse. Also for months before I had any weakness, I realized I would get hyper startled. Any kind of loud noise or sudden movement, my body would literally jump (I was never like this). Its to the point where when i play video games, my body would literally jump when something would happen in the game as if I was reacting to it like its real and my brain wasn't able to tell my body that this was not real? I have some clonus on both feet but more noticeable on left ankle. No babinski. I feel like i have spatiscity because when i use my fingers to hold something, they will tense a bit (like a contraction) and begin to twitch back and forth. I also spasm a lot esp in my neck area which I believe is due to weakness.\n* Sensory: Right before the weakness began, I had sensory symptoms like little sharp pins poking my palms, esp when my skin was holding or touching against something (so it seem both non reactive and reactive to touch). I still get them till this day but not as often as in the beginning. I also get numb very easily in feet and hands when laying on them (what usually takes minutes was felt in seconds). I get these very intense nerve irritation feelings on my legs. I begins with a sudden intense needing to itch a spot in the legs followed by intense nerve pressure surrounding the entire leg and causing my legs to spasm and flinch until its scratched.\n* Autonomic Issues: Not sure if its ALS related but before I had all the weakness symptoms, I had and still have severe autonomic issues. Any intense movement causes a sharp rise in heart rate (like 100 just from jogging for like 25 secs). My BP also has been all over the place since last year. Im 26 but my BP would sometimes go as high as 155/95 and then after it'll be 123/83. I met with a cardiologist but based on echocardiogram and stress test, he didn't feel the need to put me on any BP medication. I have an ongoing GI issue related to dysmotility since last year which created a lot of gut issues like bloating, chronic diarreah, fatty stools due to unprocessed fat in my GI system, mucus in stool, etc.\n\nAbout 4 weeks ago, I had my 3rd neurologist appt at Cedar Sinai which is a major research hospital. This neurologist was def more thorough compared to the two local ones. We spent about an hour doing clinical exams and him really listening to me thoroughly. In the end, he said the clinical exam was what he expected from a 26 year old and that everything seems to be okay. I asked him about the hyper reflexes and again since it's diffuse he said he doesn't think its anything too dangerous. He said since the 2nd EMG was done so soon and it came back completely normal, he doesn't think I need to do another EMG. He did say im severely Vitamin D deficient (i think it was at 19.6) but in the end, he doesn't think its a neurological either issue. He is gonna refer me to his colleague who is a neuromusclar specialist so hopefully he has more answers.\n\nI realized that this is super long so apologies for that but its been a rough past 4 months. Looking to have my NFL tested soon so we'll see how that goes. Sorry again for the long post!",

    "content": "I came around in morgan and adalees life when she was about a year and a half or two years old. so that would be April of 2022. ok so morgan and i had somewhat of an agreement when ian was conceived, his birthday is 04/24/23 so ian was conceived approximately July '22. i was doing restauraunt remodeling back then for niteowl construction/jared gruca. then i got into a fight at a wedding and morgan got ran over because she tried to intervene and ended up in the hospital this was may of '22 i believe. so two months go by and ian is conceived, which would make sense we were closet drinking at her parents back then when i worked at all construction, a low pay entry level gutter installation job. it grew into a decent paying job i was averaging 32$/hr at one point..then ian was born in 4/24/23 and i lost my job about 6 months later due to missing work and leaving due to the heavy load of a newborn and a 2 year old i had to help out at home more then my employer liked, so i got fired on 10/17/23. that year i worked at all construction i sent morgan over $20,000.00 over cashapp, if you want to dig im sure you could find proof, or if she was willing to state the truth you could ask her. so that would be 2023. 2024 i was employed by goodyear starting 10/30/23. i only had a 13 days of a gap of employment which i thought was good. it was a huge decrease in wages i started off at 19$/hr..i never quit providing for these kids at any point yet i was adamant about being in their life still and we haven't even got to the apartment part yet.  okay so going into 2024 was extremely rough, we had signed a lease and we were moving in 12/15/2023 i believe. Thankfully i bought most of the things we needed long in advance when i was with allconstruction and paid for the deposit/first month well beforehand. we decided to keep pushing forwards as to rasising a newborn and 2 year old at her parents house didn't seem like a feasible option to me so we continued..at the time of move in i was in jail doing 3 days mandatory time for the OVI i got that night morgan got ran over as well..i was out driving looking for her the police told me she was lifeflighted to the hospital and i was basically in panic mode..if you look into the recorded court session of my ovi i clearly stated i was taking care of a child that was not mine at the time and i explained my situation to the judge. since then i have provided for a family of 4, on a yearly wage of approximately 32,000$ while morgan was supposed to be the stay at home mom while ian was a newborn. she never found a concrete job and just left me drowning financially for the whole time we had the apartment basically. i was borrowing money off family to pay rent, my brother has paid our rent once, my dad has helped pay multiple times, and her parents have helped multiple times as well. we made it through two leases with the company, one 12 month lease and one 18 month lease. she never really stepped up and offered help outside the home, and i voiced multiple times i needed help paying bills. im not gonna break it down for you here but 33k for a family of 4 is definitely tough and i had little to no bills personally, other then phone/insurance... so that explains 2024 and most of 2025. \n\n\n\n2025 we move out 9/1/25 into her parents.\n\n\n\nwe were fighting bad the past 6 months beforehand so i was extremely concerned about moving in there with her. she has always treated me relatively bad in a sense, she was controlling, suffered from real bad anxiety so i basically did all the shopping or anything that dealt with the outdoors, she just couldn't do it. at this point we have a 2 year old and a 5 year old.\n\n\n\nit's October and i think i cleared 28,000$ so far. i guess what im trying to say is i have been steadily providing for a toxic woman who has constantly belitted me and taken advantage of me, drug me through the mud, manipulated me, she may as well of been punching me in the face on a daily basis as to that would have been easier to deal with for me. she was freaking out on me one day and i just had enough of it all..i was replacing solenoids on my Pontiac and she came home and freaked out on me for working on the car and she said something about if i was there when she got back she'd call the cops. so i just packed my stuff up and left after that. i constantly felt pushed away and taken advantage of as she was full of double standards as well.\n\n\n\n3.5 years later\n\n\n\n$100,000.00 later\n\n\n\nNothing materialistic to show for it really.\n\nI lost two cars\n\nGained one nice car on a loan w/ neal\n\nGained two kids\n\nLost f\n\n\n\ni literally kinda just noticed how materialistic ive been and its scary so i just offered morgan 75% of the tax return and i keep 25%(obviously) she will probably say no to it but i am just trying to work through all the feelings im having here i feel offended at her offers half of the time because she has held no financial responsibilities for the kids ive help raise the past 3.5 years but i love them kids i would do anything for them, and it's just money..",

    "content": "2003 Ford crown Victoria police interceptor. I’m praying the mechanics of Reddit can save me on this because I can’t afford to just replace everything. I’ll try to make this not confusing while trying to get everything I think is relevant out there. I recently got an 2003 Ford Crown Victoria police interceptor as my new to me daily driver and I drive about 70 miles a day round trip for work. The guy I got it from said he recently replaced the fuel pump and he messed up so now it has evap/ emissions codes and the check gas cap light will come on, and any time you put gas in it you have to do it slowly because it will shoot gas back at you if you don’t. Shortly after I got it I thought it had transmission issues since it would slip/ the car would rock like you’re riding a horse every time you gave it more than half throttle. So I pulled the pan and nothing looked out of the ordinary. I put some Lucas stop slip in it and it seemed to be a tad better for a few days but the issue came back. Plus here recently the car died on my two separate times while driving home from work. Another thing that messed me up is the “vehicle security system” box kept tripping and wouldn’t let me start it after unplugging the battery so I thought I had a battery issue until I figured out how to disarm my security box. Another thing I noticed and feel like may be more of my issue. My PCM relay in the engine junction box has a bypass wire in it. A lot of what I’ve found out so far is a lot of people start with replacing the PCM and the issue goes away and comes back. And a few of the people who’ve followed up past that have said it’s a wiring issue. One guy specifically showed where his issues was and another guy just replaced the whole harness. And I’m so lost when it comes to chasing wires especially since this is a retired cop car. So the harness was already jacked up from install/ removal of the cop stuff. \n\nTLDR: my car keeps dying and I think it’s a wiring issue I’m just unsure and would like to hear what you guys have to say or if anyone has experienced something similar and found their issue please share!",

    "content": "Reading through some of these stories reminded me of one very memorable evening during my rather short stint as a front desk agent. I got hired on at a hotel chain popular in the midwest/south when I was 19. Keep in mind, this was only my second job, and I had next to no experience (and few social skills). \n\nI was hired on in October of 2001, and was told that the \"rookies\" usually got saddled with working holidays. I had just moved out of my parents' and didn't mind, since I was making steady money for the first time ever. \n\nThis particular hotel chain had two iterations of their brand. The more expensive option, and the budget option, and they were basically right next door to each other. We could be scheduled to work either of the properties. I usually preferred the budget option, because it didn't have a bar and I was less likely to have to deal with drunk a-holes. \n\nFast forward to the holiday schedule - I was slated to work Xmas day, and New Year's Eve (until 11pm). When my boss handed me my schedule (she put it in with the envelope with my paycheck), she kinda laughed and said \"good luck!\". Weird, but OK. \n\nFast forward to New Year's Eve, and I was assigned the budget hotel shift. Got everyone checked in, and settled down around 7pm to do my requisite towel folding and finish my paperwork. We were sold out and everyone was accounted for, so I anticipated it being a chill night. Most people seemed to be out partying because it was super quiet. Until...\n\nA 40ish year old dude (let's call him Jack) I had checked in earlier came down to the lobby with a guitar in his hand. He asked if I minded if he sat in the lobby for a bit and played around on the guitar, since he didn't want to disturb other guests. It seemed harmless (and I was a dumb teenager), so I said sure! He strummed a couple of tunes, and then left. About a half and hour later he was back, and seemed a little...off. He plopped down again, and started playing a bit louder - this time he was singing as well. I can't for the life of me remember what the songs were, but he sounded like worse than Fergie singing the national anthem. He then reached into the small backpack he had brought down with him, and pulled out a fifth of jack and a shot glass. \n\nMy WTF meter was burying the needle, but again, dumb teenager. \n\nI watched in awe as he would do a song, then do a shot. He started crying at one point, and regaled me with a story about how the love of his life left him, and he can't even enjoy sunsets anymore. \n\nBetween the crying, the singing that made me want to actively stab my eardrums with a pencil, and the ever lowering level of Jack Daniels creeping down that bottle, I was ready to crawl into the towel cart and hide for the rest of the night. \n\nI finally crept to the back room and called the agent at the other property, and asked them what to do. They started laughing, and recommended I offer him some Coke and ice for the Jack. \n\nI tried calling my supervisor, who of course did not pick up....and the singing was getting louder. \n\nFinally, around 9:45, with most of the Jack gone and I presume his repertoire of heartbreak songs finally exhausted, he got up, took a really wobbly bow, and thanked me for being a good audience. I immediately locked the door behind him (which I was supposed to do at 10pm anyway). \n\nI was never so happy to see a guest leave the lobby.\n\nOl' Jackie Boy wasn't done though. A few minutes later, he came banging on the door, yelling that he could not get into his room. As was policy, I asked him through the intercom for his ID, which of course he did not have. He yelled, he whined, he burst into tears, and proceed to drunkenly tell me I was just like his ex and was a soul-sucking b\\*\\*\\*\\*. Dude DEFINITELY wasn't getting a replacement room key at that point. \n\nRight at this point the phone rang, and it was my supervisor calling me back from the missed call earlier. I told her what was happening, and she said she would be right there, but to definitely NOT let him in, and to dial 911. \n\nShe actually ended up getting to the property before the cops (NYE was a busy night), and pulled up just in time to see him try to swing his guitar at the front door, knock himself off balance, and fall flat on his face. Now bloodied from kicking his own a\\*\\*, he sat on under the awning crying and moaning until the police came. I have a sneaking suspicion that Jack probably threw up in the police cruiser. We gave our statements, they took him away, and I was just left with my utter shock at the whole situation. \n\nMy supervisor and I gave our statements, and she apologized for not warning me. Apparently, this dude had been showing up every NYE for the past 4-5 years years, and would always play guitar and drink in the lobby. It had become a running joke to put whoever the newest agent was at that desk. This was the first time, however, that he had gone THAT far with his shenanigans. \n\nNeedless to say, dude was officially banned from the property so the rookie hazing that was Jack and his NYE concerts was put to rest permanently.

Would that be able to support a tub?

    "content": "Hello everyone, last month I was looking to buy a motorcycle and went to meet the person about half an hour from where I live. Note it’s not the best area but it’s not a hood or anything. We chatted for a bit and he showed me around the bike, started it and let it run and revved it a few times and said I could take it for a spin. I take off just from his house and get maybe 200 feet on the same road before cop lights start flashing and he pulls me over. I mean he flew in front of me like a bat out of hell. I park it and he gets out and I hand him the keys absolutely clueless. He asked for my license, registration and insurance and I explain it’s not my bike and I just have my license. He asked if the bike had insurance and I honestly wasn’t sure, but luckily the owner walked towards us. He says he didn’t have insurance on the bike and the cop says that means that I was getting a ticket. I will add that the plate in the bike said 5-26 meaning it expires next year so normally that should have told me that it was good to ride but I was wrong. We wait a while for him to write his ticket and say some words back and forth that I can’t recall, and he says that the registration is invalid because of no insurance or vise versa I can’t remember. He smiles and says thats another ticket and we wait for him to finish up that one. He gives a speech about driving safe and he could have taken me to jail for reckless driving, while I never even reached 30, which was the speed limit. I was actually riding the bike on a roadway for around 10 seconds. I have court on the 21st and the person I met never resolved his insurance issue so I’m wondering if that means I am screwed. Is there a way to defend myself by pleading ignorant and assuming the bike was covered because the plate sticker was valid? I know that it is legally and technically my responsibility to make sure the vehicle is legal but it’s one of those things that nobody really does, at least to my knowledge and my experience. I don’t have any insurance in my name as I drive my father’s vehicle so that won’t help me. Just kinda looking for the best option so I can maybe not commit financial suicide with these tickets I may have to pay.",

    "content": "Well, I wasn't sure about posting this but here I go. I believe something really strongly that I think is happening to the Earth right now. Over a decade ago there were two Swedish sisters that presented with psychosis in the UK and ran up and down on the dual carriageway(highway) whilst the cops tried to assist. Long story short, they were hit by a lorry and a car and got back up and carried on running across the road. The cops were so afraid that they didn't know what they had seen. I believe that the sisters had undergone something, either attachment based mind control or they have been exposed to something. I have a wierd fear about places in Europe around the UK. Everything psychoanalytical and psychiatric comes from the same few areas: Germany, Sweden, Austria. I live in the UK and I am worried that something is in the bloodline of our Royal family and that Sweden has made a mistake and now it is slowly travelling around the earth. If you look up any of the big brain diseases, CJD, FFI, they all are spotted, logged and studied by the same three countries. There was a queen that had sex with a horse back in time and I feel like something has been passed down in the blood since then. What I mean is, the bloods that are taken and the tests that are conducted occur on the three countries population quota, they are never visitors or guests. I really believe that something is going on and that this cause for concern is travelling around the earth right now as we speak. I think world leaders really are getting sick, I think Trump tried a drug to see if it would work when it was seriously dangerous and I think Biden has shown symptoms of sickness too. I think China was up to date on the science behind it all, I think they've prepared for things already that involve pigs, cows and bats. However, I think the one thing they haven't catered for but may get the blame for is encephalitis in horses. Now that the horse is in the picture, it's time to start looking into the cows of Europe. Did you know that European cows are strangely curious? Cows are used in India all the time for work and none of the cows in India show any interest or curiosity in the people all around them. However, European cows, eapecially those from Norway, Sweden, Austria etc come over to humans who sing, chase humans along hedgerows and generally stand gawping with a warped sense of curiosity. Something is happening and we need to open our eyes. Schizophrenia is scrapie and scrapie is spreading and that's why the doctors didn't know what schizophrenia was for so long as there was no physical proof. Now they say there is, so weird people! This world terrifies me every single day. ",

    "content": "The thing about Ryan was that he never committed to anything scary. Horror movies were out. Roller coasters were out. Even choosing colleges stressed him out because it meant closing doors, making something real and final. His therapist called it 'decision paralysis.' I called it self-preservation. When your dad walks out and your mom stops getting out of bed, you learn that some questions are better left unasked.\n\nI understood that. Ryan's mom had the kind of depression that kept the curtains drawn for weeks at a time. His dad left when Ryan was eleven, and the last thing the guy said before walking out was that Ryan needed to \"man up and help your mother.\" So Ryan learned to be quiet. To fade into the background of rooms. To make himself small enough that his presence wouldn't be another burden for anyone to carry.\n\nCasey was the opposite. She took up space like she'd been told her whole life she deserved to. Student council, debate team, Instagram aesthetic so carefully curated it looked effortless. Her parents were the kind of people who showed up to every event with professional cameras, who had her entire academic future mapped out on a literal poster board in their home office. Yale, then law school, then partnership in her father's firm.\n\nThe thing was, Casey actually wanted none of that. She'd told me once, sophomore year, that she wished she could just work in a plant nursery. Spend her days with her hands in dirt, helping things grow. But she'd said it like it was a joke, like the idea of disappointing her parents was so unthinkable it could only exist as fantasy.\n\nAnd Luke. Luke was more complicated than I wanted him to be.\n\nHe was tall, yeah. Played varsity football. Had the kind of easy confidence that came from never being told he couldn't do something. But here's the thing nobody else seemed to notice: Luke's dad hit him. Not often enough to leave marks that lasted, but enough. I'd seen Luke flinch once when Ryan clapped him on the shoulder too suddenly. Seen the way he stood sometimes, favoring his left side like his ribs were sore. He never talked about it, and I never asked, but it was there between us like smoke.\n\nThat's why he cheated on Casey, probably. Self-sabotage as a kind of protection. If you ruin it first, nobody can take it from you. I understood the logic even if I hated what it did to her. Even if watching her take him back felt like watching someone walk into traffic.\n\nMe? I was just trying to get through high school without my own damage becoming everyone else's problem.\n\nThe folklore started on a Reddit thread. Someone's uncle's coworker knew a guy who'd gone into the woods behind County Memorial and come back wrong. Different. Kept talking about prices and payments and how everything cost something. Three weeks later, he drove his truck into the lake with his whole family inside.\n\n\"It's bullshit,\" Ryan had said when Casey first brought it up, but his fingers were already drumming that nervous pattern on his knee. The one that meant he was thinking about it too hard, letting it get under his skin.\n\n\"Probably,\" Casey said. She was scrolling through satellite images of the hospital on her phone, zooming in on the forest that pressed against its southern edge. \"But wouldn't it be cool to check out? Just the hospital, I mean. Urban exploration.\"\n\nThe hospital had been abandoned since 2003. County Memorial, built in the forties, shut down after some Medicare fraud thing bankrupted the board. Six stories of brick and broken windows, wrapped in chain-link and covered in the kind of graffiti that suggested people came here specifically to be forgotten. The forest beyond it was old growth pine, dense enough that hikers got lost every few years. Search parties, helicopters, the whole production. Sometimes they found the bodies.\n\nWe were standing by Casey's locker between third and fourth period when she pitched the idea. Ryan looked like he wanted to crawl into the ventilation system. I was trying to figure out how to say no without sounding as scared as I felt when Luke appeared.\n\nHe had this way of moving through crowds like they were designed to part for him. People just stepped aside. He came up behind Casey and wrapped his arms around her waist, lifting her off her feet. She shrieked, kicking her legs, laughing in that way that made my stomach hurt.\n\n\"What are we talking about?\" Luke asked, setting her down.\n\nCasey turned in his arms, already grinning. \"The hospital. The one with the woods out back. We're thinking of exploring it.\"\n\n\"Sounds boring,\" Luke said, but he was looking at me when he said it, one eyebrow raised. \"Unless you're afraid.\"\n\nThere it was. The hook. Luke knew exactly what he was doing. He'd been doing it since middle school, this casual needling that made saying no feel like admitting weakness. It was manipulative and obvious and it worked anyway because I was seventeen and stupid.\n\n\"Tonight,\" I said. \"Seven o'clock.\"\n\nLuke smiled. Ryan looked like he might throw up.\n\nI told my parents I was sleeping at Ryan's. They barely looked up from their respective screens. My dad worked in insurance, my mom taught elementary school, and both of them seemed relieved I had friends to occupy my time. Teenagers were a mystery they'd decided not to solve.\n\nI climbed out my bedroom window at six thirty, dropping into the backyard with an impact that made my ankles ache. My bike was old, inherited from a cousin, and the chain made a clicking sound that seemed too loud in the quiet suburban evening. I texted Ryan that I was heading out. He sent back a thumbs up and nothing else.\n\nThe hospital was four miles away, past the nice part of town and into the part where houses had bars on the windows. The sun was setting, turning the sky the color of a bruise. By the time I reached the parking lot, full dark had fallen.\n\nThe place looked worse than the photos suggested. The fog was real, thick enough that it pooled in low spots like something liquid. The hospital loomed beyond it, all those shattered windows like eye sockets in a skull. Someone had painted \"MEMENTO MORI\" across the main entrance in dripping red letters.\n\nMy breath came out in clouds. October in New England, the kind of cold that got into your bones and stayed there. I tried Ryan's phone. It went straight to voicemail. Casey's rang four times and went to her cheerful recording.\n\nI took a photo. Posted it to Instagram with the caption \"bad decisions loading...\" and watched it get three likes before I'd even pocketed my phone.\n\nHeadlights swept across the lot. Luke's Camaro, black and impractical, his dad's castoff. The engine ticked as it cooled. Luke climbed out first, Casey from the passenger side. She was wearing his letterman jacket over her hoodie, drowning in it.\n\n\"Jesus,\" Luke said, breath fogging. \"It's freezing. Remind me why we're doing this?\"\n\n\"Adventure,\" Casey said, but she'd lost some of that enthusiasm from earlier. She looked small in the empty parking lot, younger than usual.\n\n\"Ryan's not here yet,\" I said.\n\nLuke snorted. \"Probably chickened out.\"\n\nThen we heard the bike. Ryan came pedaling into the lot like he was being chased, skidding to a stop next to mine. His helmet was crooked, his face flushed red from cold and exertion.\n\n\"Where the hell were you?\" I asked. \"I called.\"\n\n\"Got lost,\" Ryan panted. \"No signal out here. Everything looks the same in the dark.\"\n\nCasey was staring at the hospital now, really looking at it. \"Maybe this is stupid,\" she said quietly. \"Maybe we should just go home.\"\n\n\"We drove all the way out here,\" Luke said. He was already walking toward the building, hands shoved in his jacket pockets. \"Come on.\"\n\nWe followed the fence line around to the back. Up close, the hospital felt worse. Bigger. More present. Like it was aware of us in some fundamental way. The windows on the ground floor were boarded over, but higher up they gaped open, and I kept expecting to see movement in them. A face. A hand.\n\nRyan was breathing too fast, that panicky rhythm that meant he was spiraling. I'd seen it before, usually during tests or when his mom called during school.\n\nThe forest pressed against the fence, trees so dense they looked solid. Pine and oak and something that made the air smell like decay. We found a spot where someone had cut the chain link and peeled it back like the lid on a can.\n\n\"So we're really doing this?\" Casey asked. Nobody answered.\n\nLuke went first, ducking through. Then Casey. Then me and Ryan, who looked like he was walking to his execution.\n\nThe forest was colder. That shouldn't have been possible, but it was. Our phone lights made narrow tunnels in the dark, catching on bark and exposed roots and something that might have been animal bones. We walked single file, nobody speaking. There was no path. Just trees and darkness and the sound of our breathing.\n\nFive minutes in, Luke stopped.\n\n\"This is stupid,\" he said. \"There's nothing here. Let's go back, check out the hospital instead.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Casey said quickly. \"The hospital. Better idea.\"\n\nWe turned around. That's when something moved in the trees behind us.\n\nHeavy. Deliberate. The sound of something large displacing air. Casey backed into Luke, grabbing his arm. Ryan had gone statue-still, and when I looked at him, his face had lost all color.\n\n\"Animal,\" Luke said, but his voice was wrong. Too high.\n\nThe thing moved again. Closer. And with it came a sound like wind chimes made of bone, a clicking rattle that made my teeth ache.\n\nIt stepped into the light.\n\nI want to tell you I processed what I was seeing. That my brain took in the details and categorized them in any useful way. But that's not what happened. What happened was my mind just stopped, like a computer program hitting a fatal error.\n\nSeven feet tall, maybe more. A shape that suggested a body but refused to confirm one. Draped in moss and forest rot, organic material that might have been fabric or flesh or something in between. And the head. God. A deer skull, bleached white, antlers spreading like broken fingers. Around its neck, strung on what looked like sinew, hung dozens of teeth. Human teeth, maybe. Or animal. The distinction seemed less important than the fact of their existence.\n\nIt had no eyes but I felt it looking at us. Looking into us.\n\nLuke made a sound I'd never heard him make before, something between a sob and a laugh.\n\nThe thing's jaw opened. Not like a jaw should, but hinging wrong, too wide, and when it spoke, the voice came from everywhere and nowhere. From inside my skull and from the ground and from the air itself.\n\n\"You come to wish.\"\n\nThe words scraped like rusted metal dragging across bone.\n\n\"All of you must wish.\"\n\nCasey was crying. I could hear it, small hitching sobs behind me, but I couldn't turn to look at her. Couldn't stop staring at the creature, at the way it seemed to shift and settle like it wasn't quite solid, wasn't quite real.\n\nThe skull twitched toward Ryan.\n\nRyan opened his mouth. Closed it. His hands were shaking so badly I could see it even in the bad light.\n\n\"Wish,\" the creature said, and its voice got louder, resonant, shaking the trees. \"WISH NOW.\"\n\n\"I wish,\" Ryan started, then stopped. His voice was barely a whisper. \"I wish to know if God is real.\"\n\nI don't know what I expected. Maybe nothing. Maybe for the thing to laugh or vanish or tell us we were all idiots playing with urban legends. But that's not what happened.\n\nThe creature convulsed. Its body, that shapeless mass, began twitching violently, and the deer skull lurched sideways at an angle that made my stomach turn. The bone necklace rattled in the opposite direction, spinning, and the sound it made was like grinding vertebrae.\n\nRyan screamed.\n\nNot a shout or a yell. A scream. The kind that carries agony and terror in equal measure, that sounds like someone being unmade at the molecular level. His hands shot to his head, fingers clawing at his skull, and then I saw it happen.\n\nHis head was collapsing inward.\n\nThe bones of his skull were folding like paper, caving in on themselves, and his face, Ryan's face, the one I'd known since we were twelve, was disappearing into the void it left behind. The skin went slack and then concave, and the scream cut off into something wet and horrible and then into nothing at all.\n\nHe hit the ground.\n\nCasey's scream replaced his, raw and primal. Luke grabbed her arm hard enough to bruise.\n\n\"Run,\" he said.\n\nWe ran.\n\nI crashed through a low hanging branch that whipped across my face, bark scraping my cheek raw. My phone was in my hand, light jerking wildly, turning the forest into a strobe nightmare of trees and shadows and nothing that made sense. Behind us, I could hear it. That rattling. Bone on bone, getting closer.\n\nCasey was sobbing as she ran, these gasping, hitching breaths between footfalls. Luke was ahead of her, pulling her by the wrist, and I was behind them both, and I couldn't stop thinking about Ryan. About the way his face had just collapsed, folded in on itself like wet cardboard.\n\nMy foot caught on a root and I went down hard, phone flying from my hand. The impact knocked the air from my lungs. I scrabbled in the dirt, fingers finding leaves and moss and something that felt horribly like bone before my hand closed around the phone.\n\nThe light was facing back the way we'd come.\n\nThe creature was there.\n\nNot far. Maybe twenty feet. Moving through the trees with that horrible fluid motion, branches bending around it like they were afraid to touch it. The deer skull was angled toward me, antlers scraping bark, and the bone necklace swayed and clattered with each movement.\n\nI could see details now that I hadn't before. The way the moss covering its body seemed to grow and shift, pulsing like something alive. The teeth on the necklace weren't all the same size. Some were small, child-sized. Others were long and pointed, predator teeth. And there were other things strung between them. Small bones. Finger bones maybe. And something that looked horrifyingly like a dried human ear.\n\n\"GET UP!\" Luke's voice, somewhere ahead in the darkness.\n\nI rolled onto my hands and knees, pushed myself up. My ankle screamed in protest but held. I ran.\n\nThe forest had become a maze. Every tree looked the same. Every shadow held something terrible. My lungs burned. The cold air felt like breathing broken glass. I could hear Luke and Casey ahead, crashing through undergrowth, and I pushed harder, trying to catch up.\n\nBehind me, that rattling never stopped. It stayed constant, rhythmic, like the creature was pacing itself. Like it knew it didn't need to rush. Like this was all part of something it had done a thousand times before.\n\nMy phone light caught Casey's jacket ahead, that bright red. I focused on it, used it as a beacon. We were running uphill now, the ground getting steeper, roots reaching across the path like fingers trying to trip us. My thighs burned. My ankle throbbed with each impact.\n\nThen Casey went down.\n\nShe cried out, a sharp yelp of pain, and Luke skidded to a stop. I nearly crashed into him. Casey was on the ground, clutching her leg, her phone a few feet away casting crazy shadows across her face.\n\n\"I can't,\" she gasped. \"My ankle, I can't.\"\n\nLuke looked back. Even in the bad light, I could see his face. The calculation happening there. The math of who lives and who dies.\n\n\"Help me get her up,\" I said, moving to Casey's other side.\n\nWe each took an arm, hauled her to her feet. She whimpered, tried to put weight on her right leg and nearly collapsed again. Luke and I locked our arms behind her back, made a kind of chair. She looped her arms around our necks.\n\nWe moved slower now. So much slower. Casey's weight between us, her breathing ragged in my ear. The creature's rattling got louder. Closer. I could feel its presence like a pressure change, like the air itself was being displaced by something too large, too wrong.\n\n\"There,\" Luke panted. \"I see the fence.\"\n\nAnd there it was, chain-link glinting in our phone lights, and beyond it, the dark mass of the hospital. We were coming at it from an angle, not the way we'd entered. This section of fence was intact but there was a spot maybe ten yards down where it had been peeled back.\n\nWe staggered toward it, Casey's weight making every step feel like we were wading through concrete. Five yards. Three.\n\nBehind us, branches cracked. Not the small pops of twigs breaking. The deep groan of something large pushing through resistance. I risked a look back.\n\nThe creature had closed the distance. It was right there, maybe fifteen feet away, and in the better light near the fence line I could see it clearly for the first time.\n\nIt wasn't wearing the moss and rot. That was its skin. Bark and organic material fused together into something that might have once been alive but had evolved past that into something else. The deer skull was partially embedded in its body, grown into it, and where the skull ended and the body began was impossible to determine. The antlers weren't antlers at all. They were bones. Human bones. Femurs and radius and ulna, all twisted and fused together into that branching structure.\n\nAnd the worst part, the part that made my bladder almost let go, was that the skull was moving. Not the creature's head, but the skull itself. The jaw was opening and closing in a rhythm that matched the rattling of the bone necklace, and I could see something behind the bone. Something dark and writhing, like the inside of the skull was full of worms or maggots or things that squirmed.\n\n\"Go, go, GO!\" I screamed.\n\nWe hit the fence line. Luke dropped Casey's arm, grabbed the peeled-back section and hauled it up. The metal shrieked. Casey went under first, on her hands and knees, crawling. I was right behind her, and behind me I could hear the creature moving faster now, could hear that rattling building to a crescendo.\n\nI was halfway under when I felt something grab my jacket. Not a hand. Nothing as simple as a hand. Something that felt like it had too many points of contact, like it was gripping me in six places at once. The fabric pulled taut, yanking me backward, and I screamed.\n\nCasey was on the other side, reaching back through, grabbing my arms. Luke was there too, pulling. I was caught between them, the fence cutting into my back, the creature's grip tightening. I could smell it now. Rot and earth and something sweet underneath, like decomposition, like meat going bad in the sun.\n\nMy jacket tore.\n\nThe sound was loud, that ripping canvas noise, and suddenly I was sliding forward, under the fence, Luke and Casey falling backward with me on top. We landed in a heap on the asphalt. I rolled, looked back.\n\nThe creature was pressed against the fence. Not trying to climb it or break through. Just standing there, that deer skull tilted, watching us. The bone necklace had gone still. In the parking lot lights, I could see my jacket, or what was left of it, hanging from one of the fence posts. It was shredded. Not cut. Shredded, like something with claws had grabbed it.\n\nBut the creature had no hands.\n\n\"Come on,\" Luke said, already pulling Casey to her feet. \"The hospital. We get inside, we're safe.\"\n\nI didn't know what made him think that. Didn't know what made him think we'd be safe anywhere. But the alternative was standing here in the parking lot while that thing watched us, so I got up and ran.\n\nThe hospital entrance gaped open. Someone had torn the boards off years ago. Inside was darkness, deeper than the forest, and that smell. Mold and decay and stale air that hadn't moved in decades. Our phones lit the way, catching on debris. A wheelchair, rusted, one wheel missing. Medical charts scattered across the floor, patient names still visible. An IV stand lying on its side.\n\nWe moved into the lobby, a wide open space with a reception desk that had been stripped of anything valuable. The floor was tile, broken in places, and our footsteps echoed wrong. Too loud. Like the building was paying attention.\n\n\"We can't stay here,\" Casey said. She was limping badly, putting almost no weight on her right leg. \"It'll come in. It'll find us.\"\n\n\"Then we go up,\" Luke said, gesturing to a stairwell on the far side of the lobby. \"Get to the second floor, find a room we can barricade.\"\n\n\"Or we go straight through,\" I said, pointing to a hallway that led deeper into the building. \"Find the other side, get back to the parking lot. Get to the car.\"\n\nLuke looked at Casey, then at me. I saw the decision forming. Saw the exact moment he chose.\n\n\"Through is faster,\" he said, already moving toward the hallway.\n\nWe followed. Casey between us again, hobbling, trying to keep up. The hallway was narrower than the lobby, doors lining both sides. Most were closed. Some hung open, revealing rooms full of stripped beds and broken equipment. Our phone lights made everything worse, turning shadows into threats, making every corner a potential ambush.\n\nWe passed a nurse's station. The desk was overturned, papers everywhere, and something had made a nest in the corner. I couldn't tell what. Blankets and trash and something else, something organic that I didn't want to look at too closely.\n\nThen we heard it behind us.\n\nThat rattling.\n\nInside the building now. In the lobby. The sound echoed off the walls, distorted, making it impossible to tell exactly where it was coming from. But it was close. Getting closer.\n\n\"Faster,\" Luke hissed.\n\nCasey was crying again, quiet sobs that she was trying to muffle. We were moving as fast as we could, but her ankle was bad, really bad, and each step was agony for her. I could feel it in the way she gripped my shoulder, nails digging in through my shirt.\n\nThe hallway branched. Luke took the left corridor without hesitating. We followed. This hallway was darker somehow, fewer windows, and the air felt thicker. Harder to breathe. Like the building's decay had concentrated here.\n\nBehind us, the rattling got louder. I risked a look back and saw nothing but darkness and the pathetic throw of our phone lights. But I could feel it. That presence. That wrongness.\n\n\"There,\" Luke said, pointing ahead.\n\nA door. Different from the others. Metal instead of wood, with a small window set at eye level. Emergency exit, maybe. A way out. We stumbled toward it, Casey whimpering with each step, and Luke hit it at full speed.\n\nIt didn't budge.\n\nHe slammed into it, bounced back, tried the handle. Locked. He threw his shoulder against it again, and again, and the door rattled in its frame but held.\n\n\"Fuck,\" he said. \"Fuck, fuck, FUCK.\"\n\nThe rattling was louder now. So loud it seemed to come from the walls themselves. I turned, putting myself between Casey and the direction we'd come, and my phone light caught movement at the end of the hallway.\n\nThe creature was there.\n\nIt had to hunch to fit in the corridor, that deer skull scraping the ceiling tiles. Bits of acoustic foam rained down as it moved, and the sound of its passage was wrong. Wet and grinding, like meat being forced through a space too small.\n\n\"Luke,\" I said, and my voice was surprisingly steady. \"We need to move.\"\n\n\"The door's locked!\"\n\n\"Then we find another door!\"\n\nLuke grabbed Casey's arm and pulled her away from the exit. We ran back the way we'd come, but the creature was blocking that path now, so we took the first door we came to. It opened into a patient room, and we slammed it shut behind us.\n\nThe room was small. A single bed, stripped to the frame. A window with bars on it, glass long gone, letting in cold air and the smell of the forest. A small bathroom in the corner, door hanging off one hinge.\n\n\"We're trapped,\" Casey said. She'd given up trying to stop crying. Tears tracked down her face, catching in our phone lights. \"We're trapped and it's going to kill us.\"\n\n\"There has to be another way out,\" I said, moving to the window. The bars were solid, old but not rusted enough to break. I shook them anyway. They didn't move.\n\nBehind us, in the hallway, the rattling had stopped.\n\nThe silence was worse. So much worse. Because silence meant it was listening. Hunting. Planning.\n\nLuke was at the door, ear pressed against it, trying to hear movement. His hand was on the handle, knuckles white.\n\n\"I don't hear anything,\" he whispered.\n\n\"That doesn't mean it's not there,\" Casey said.\n\nWe waited. Seconds that felt like hours. My heart was beating so hard I could feel it in my throat, in my temples. The cold air from the window made me shiver, or maybe that was just fear. Probably fear.\n\nThen something scraped against the door.\n\nNot a knock. A long, drawn-out scrape, like bone on metal. The door shuddered. Luke jumped back, nearly dropping his phone.\n\nThe scraping came again, lower this time. Then higher. Like the thing was testing the door, learning its dimensions.\n\nThe handle started to turn.\n\nLuke grabbed it, tried to hold it, but the force on the other side was immense. The handle turned despite his grip, despite him throwing his weight against it, and the door began to open.\n\n\"Help me!\" Luke screamed.\n\nI ran to the door, added my weight. Casey was there too, her bad ankle forgotten, all of us pressing against the door as it slowly, inexorably, opened. It was like trying to hold back a freight train. Like trying to stop gravity.\n\nThe door opened six inches. Then a foot. Through the gap, I could see the hallway, and I could see the creature.\n\nIt had changed. Or maybe I was just seeing it more clearly. The deer skull was at ground level now, and I realized the creature didn't have a fixed orientation. It could move in any direction, could reorient itself however it needed. The skull was sideways now, antlers scraping the doorframe, and behind it, that body of moss and rot and wrong, and in the darkness behind the skull's eye sockets, I saw movement. Saw things writhing.\n\nThe door opened another foot.\n\n\"The bathroom!\" Casey screamed. \"Go, go!\"\n\nWe broke, all of us at once, abandoning the door and sprinting for the bathroom. It was tiny, barely enough room for the three of us, but we crammed inside and Luke grabbed the door. This one was lighter, flimsier, but it had a lock. He turned it just as the patient room door slammed open behind us.\n\nThe creature filled the doorway.\n\nThrough the crack at the bottom of the bathroom door, I could see it. Could see that mass of organic material spreading across the tile, and the shadow it cast was wrong. Too many angles. Too much depth.\n\nThen came the voice.\n\n\"Wish,\" it said, and the word rattled through the building. \"Must wish. All must wish.\"\n\nLuke's face was white. He was backed against the sink, hands gripping the porcelain like it was the only thing keeping him upright. Casey was in the corner, arms wrapped around herself, rocking slightly.\n\nThe door shuddered. Something hit it, heavy, and the wood cracked.\n\n\"Wish,\" the creature said again. \"You. Wish. NOW.\"\n\nThe door splintered. Wood shards exploded inward. A piece hit my arm, drawing blood. Through the hole in the door, I could see the deer skull, could see those empty sockets looking in at us.\n\nLuke's voice came out strangled, desperate.\n\n\"I wish you were dead,\" he said. \"I wish you were fucking dead.\"\n\nThe creature's response was immediate. The deer skull snapped back, and that rattling started again, frenzied, and Luke's hands flew to his back.\n\nHe screamed.\n\nNot like Ryan. Different. This was a scream of confusion more than pain, at least at first. Then the pain came. I watched his body arch backward, watched his shirt collapse inward like something was being pulled out from underneath, and I understood.\n\nThe creature was removing his spine.\n\nNot all at once. Bone by bone. Vertebra by vertebra. I could see them going, could see the shirt fabric cave where each bone disappeared. Luke's body bent backward, farther than any body should bend, and the scream went on and on until his lungs couldn't support it anymore and it became a wet gurgle.\n\nThen he fell.\n\nCasey was screaming. Had been screaming. I grabbed her, pulled her close, but she fought me. Pushed me away.\n\n\"No!\" she shouted at the creature. At the deer skull watching us through the broken door. \"I wish none of this ever happened! I wish we never came here!\"\n\nAnd the world broke.\n\nThat's the only way I can describe it. Reality fractured like glass, and through the cracks I could see something else. Other versions of this moment. Other timelines where we made different choices. Where we didn't come. Where we turned back. Where Ryan said something else. All of them existing simultaneously, overlapping, bleeding into each other.\n\nThe buzzing started in my skull, building and building until I thought my head would explode. The bathroom walls rippled like water. Casey was there and then not there and then there again, flickering like a broken film strip. The creature's rattling became a roar, became everything, became the only sound in existence.\n\nI fell.\n\nOr flew.\n\nOr both.\n\nTime inverted. Collapsed. Expanded. I saw Ryan's face caving in again but backward, saw it inflate like a balloon. Saw Luke's spine returning, then disappearing again. Saw Casey running, screaming, laughing, all at the same time.\n\nThen it stopped.\n\nComplete silence. Complete stillness.\n\nI was on my back, staring up at nothing. No, not nothing. Stars. I was staring at stars. My hands were on asphalt, cold and rough. I sat up slowly, carefully, like any sudden movement might shatter whatever fragile reality had formed around me.\n\nI was in the parking lot.\n\nNot near it. In it. Lying next to Luke's Camaro. The driver's side door hung open. The dome light was on, casting everything in sickly yellow.\n\nI stood. My legs shook but held. I turned slowly, taking it in. The parking lot. The hospital in the distance. The forest pressing against the fence line.\n\nAnd Luke's car.\n\nI knew before I looked. Somehow I knew. But I looked anyway.\n\nLuke was in the driver's seat. Slumped over the steering wheel, his body bent at an angle that was only possible because there was nothing inside to stop it bending that way. His shirt had collapsed inward, empty, and even from outside the car I could see the void where his spine should have been.\n\nI made a sound. Not quite a scream. Not quite a sob. Something in between.\n\nI walked around to the passenger side on legs that didn't feel like mine. Opened the door with hands that had forgotten how to shake.\n\nCasey was there.\n\nFolded in on herself like origami. Her torso compressed, caved in, her body bent over her knees in a way that revealed the complete absence of ribs. Her ribcage was gone. Removed. Taken as payment.\n\nHer head rested on the dashboard, eyes open but not seeing. Not anymore.\n\nI closed the door carefully. Gently. Like she might wake up if I made too much noise.\n\nRyan's bike was still there. Still propped against the light pole where he'd left it.\n\nRyan was next to it.\n\nI couldn't look at him. Not directly. My eyes skated away from what was left of his face, from the collapsed ruin of his skull. But I saw enough. I saw the bike visible through where his head used to be. Saw the way his body looked boneless, deflated.\n\nI sat down in the parking lot. Right there on the cold asphalt. And I laughed. Not because anything was funny. Just because something had to come out and laughter was what my body chose. It turned into crying pretty quickly. Then back to laughing. Then I couldn't tell which one I was doing anymore.\n\nEventually, I called 911.\n\nTold them there'd been an accident at County Memorial. They asked what kind of accident and I said, \"You need to come. Please just come.\"\n\nThe cops arrived first. Then the ambulances. Then more cops. They separated me from the bodies, wrapped me in a foil blanket, asked questions I couldn't answer. What happened? Where were you? What did you see?\n\nI told them the truth. All of it. The creature. The wishes. The hospital.\n\nThey wrote it down with the kind of careful attention people give the clearly insane.\n\nBy morning, I was in the back of a police car. By afternoon, I was in a psychiatric ward.\n\nThey were kind. That's what made it worse. Everyone so gentle, so understanding. Asking me about what I'd experienced, nodding when I talked about the creature, taking careful notes. The medications came in little cups, pills that made everything feel distant and manageable.\n\n\"It was a psychotic break,\" the doctor told me after the first week. \"Trauma manifesting as hallucination. You survived something terrible and your mind created a narrative to cope.\"\n\nI learned to agree with him. Learned to say the right things, to show the right amount of progress. Three months of good behavior, of taking the pills, of going to group therapy and pretending I believed what they believed.\n\nThen they approved an outing. A supervised trip back into the world.\n\n\"We think you're ready,\" the doctor said. \"Ready to reintegrate.\"\n\nI know where I'm going.\n\nI know what I'll do.\n\nThe creature said we all had to wish. Ryan did. Luke did. Casey did. But I never made mine. The creature is still waiting. It has to be. Those are the rules.\n\nI'll go back to those woods. I'll find it in the darkness between the trees. And I'll say the words that have been circling in my head for three months, the only wish that makes sense now.\n\nMaybe it won't work. Maybe the creature is gone, maybe the rules don't function that way, maybe I'm just crazy after all and I'll wander those woods until I die of exposure.\n\nBut I have to try.\n\nBecause this, right here, breathing and walking and pretending to be alive while they're in the ground, this is the real horror. This is the real price.\n\nAnd tomorrow, I'm going to pay it.",

    "content": "Every day for 30 days I’m watching a different scary movie, this year all about alien invasions.\n\nThere’s a moviemaking term called “squeezing the lemon,” which means doing everything you can to maximize the potential of your movie’s concept. \n\nAt the risk of sounding like a deeply old man, if I have one big complaint about a lot of Hollywood movies today, it’s that they don’t squeeze the lemon hard enough.\n\nOn the other hand, “Killer Klowns From Outer Space” ANNIHILATES the lemon; there’s not a seed or fiber left when the credits roll. Whatever you think of the idea of a horror/comedy about sadistic outer space clowns invading Maycomb County, it is hard to argue anyone could have done more with it than we get here.\n\nWritten, directed, and produced by trio of effects whizzes the Chiodo Brothers, “Killer Klowns” rips off “The Blob” beat for beat, complete with the Lover’s Lane meteor sighting and skeptical cops blowing off the warnings of ne’er-do-well kids.\n\nExcept of course, it’s not the blob this time, it’s, well, clowns. Filmed in the South Bay, the movie stretches its tiny budget to fantastical lengths to generate credible atmosphere and punk rock sensibility. \n\nOn paper I should hate “Killer Klowns,” since I find clown imagery in horror generally hacky, and also, with some notable exceptions, I’m not a big fan of horror-comedies; it’s good for a horror movie to have a sense of humor, but generally I think displays of this kind of violence should at least try to take themselves seriously.\n\nBut I’m only human, and there’s something so immaculate and all-encompassing about “Killer Klowns From Outer Space” that it verges on a spiritual experience–like every B-movie of the past was somehow paving the way for the New Testament of this perfect garbage.\n\nThe casting is hit-or-miss: I love the sadistic middle-aged cop played by “Animal House” dean John Vernon, and the Good Cop played by John Nelson comes off as a pretty credible action lead considering how heavy of a lift he’s handed here. The various “teenage” actors are just kind of there though, and I find the comic relief brothers incredibly annoying.\n\nThat’s okay though, since the knockout makeup effects and ingeniously stupid “clown” gags are the real stars. This movie was a surprise box office hit and achieved immortality in the post-theatrical Valhalla of 90s cable TV. \n\nVarious attempts to resurrect it through sequels, remakes, and streaming series have failed, but maybe that’s just as well, because surely they pretty much nailed it the first time?\n\n“Killer Klowns” of course is the proverbial example of getting a laugh out of your horror premise on purpose, but what about those films that WEREN’T trying to be funny and landed there anyway?\n\nMore on that tomorrow.\n\nOriginal Trailer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVQ3AGzeB_0\n\nFull Sheet Poster:\n",

    "content": "The thing about Ryan was that he never committed to anything scary. Horror movies were out. Roller coasters were out. Even choosing colleges stressed him out because it meant closing doors, making something real and final. His therapist called it 'decision paralysis.' I called it self-preservation. When your dad walks out and your mom stops getting out of bed, you learn that some questions are better left unasked.\n\nI understood that. Ryan's mom had the kind of depression that kept the curtains drawn for weeks at a time. His dad left when Ryan was eleven, and the last thing the guy said before walking out was that Ryan needed to \"man up and help your mother.\" So Ryan learned to be quiet. To fade into the background of rooms. To make himself small enough that his presence wouldn't be another burden for anyone to carry.\n\nCasey was the opposite. She took up space like she'd been told her whole life she deserved to. Student council, debate team, Instagram aesthetic so carefully curated it looked effortless. Her parents were the kind of people who showed up to every event with professional cameras, who had her entire academic future mapped out on a literal poster board in their home office. Yale, then law school, then partnership in her father's firm.\n\nThe thing was, Casey actually wanted none of that. She'd told me once, sophomore year, that she wished she could just work in a plant nursery. Spend her days with her hands in dirt, helping things grow. But she'd said it like it was a joke, like the idea of disappointing her parents was so unthinkable it could only exist as fantasy.\n\nAnd Luke. Luke was more complicated than I wanted him to be.\n\nHe was tall, yeah. Played varsity football. Had the kind of easy confidence that came from never being told he couldn't do something. But here's the thing nobody else seemed to notice: Luke's dad hit him. Not often enough to leave marks that lasted, but enough. I'd seen Luke flinch once when Ryan clapped him on the shoulder too suddenly. Seen the way he stood sometimes, favoring his left side like his ribs were sore. He never talked about it, and I never asked, but it was there between us like smoke.\n\nThat's why he cheated on Casey, probably. Self-sabotage as a kind of protection. If you ruin it first, nobody can take it from you. I understood the logic even if I hated what it did to her. Even if watching her take him back felt like watching someone walk into traffic.\n\nMe? I was just trying to get through high school without my own damage becoming everyone else's problem.\n\nThe folklore started on a Reddit thread. Someone's uncle's coworker knew a guy who'd gone into the woods behind County Memorial and come back wrong. Different. Kept talking about prices and payments and how everything cost something. Three weeks later, he drove his truck into the lake with his whole family inside.\n\n\"It's bullshit,\" Ryan had said when Casey first brought it up, but his fingers were already drumming that nervous pattern on his knee. The one that meant he was thinking about it too hard, letting it get under his skin.\n\n\"Probably,\" Casey said. She was scrolling through satellite images of the hospital on her phone, zooming in on the forest that pressed against its southern edge. \"But wouldn't it be cool to check out? Just the hospital, I mean. Urban exploration.\"\n\nThe hospital had been abandoned since 2003. County Memorial, built in the forties, shut down after some Medicare fraud thing bankrupted the board. Six stories of brick and broken windows, wrapped in chain-link and covered in the kind of graffiti that suggested people came here specifically to be forgotten. The forest beyond it was old growth pine, dense enough that hikers got lost every few years. Search parties, helicopters, the whole production. Sometimes they found the bodies.\n\nWe were standing by Casey's locker between third and fourth period when she pitched the idea. Ryan looked like he wanted to crawl into the ventilation system. I was trying to figure out how to say no without sounding as scared as I felt when Luke appeared.\n\nHe had this way of moving through crowds like they were designed to part for him. People just stepped aside. He came up behind Casey and wrapped his arms around her waist, lifting her off her feet. She shrieked, kicking her legs, laughing in that way that made my stomach hurt.\n\n\"What are we talking about?\" Luke asked, setting her down.\n\nCasey turned in his arms, already grinning. \"The hospital. The one with the woods out back. We're thinking of exploring it.\"\n\n\"Sounds boring,\" Luke said, but he was looking at me when he said it, one eyebrow raised. \"Unless you're afraid.\"\n\nThere it was. The hook. Luke knew exactly what he was doing. He'd been doing it since middle school, this casual needling that made saying no feel like admitting weakness. It was manipulative and obvious and it worked anyway because I was seventeen and stupid.\n\n\"Tonight,\" I said. \"Seven o'clock.\"\n\nLuke smiled. Ryan looked like he might throw up.\n\nI told my parents I was sleeping at Ryan's. They barely looked up from their respective screens. My dad worked in insurance, my mom taught elementary school, and both of them seemed relieved I had friends to occupy my time. Teenagers were a mystery they'd decided not to solve.\n\nI climbed out my bedroom window at six thirty, dropping into the backyard with an impact that made my ankles ache. My bike was old, inherited from a cousin, and the chain made a clicking sound that seemed too loud in the quiet suburban evening. I texted Ryan that I was heading out. He sent back a thumbs up and nothing else.\n\nThe hospital was four miles away, past the nice part of town and into the part where houses had bars on the windows. The sun was setting, turning the sky the color of a bruise. By the time I reached the parking lot, full dark had fallen.\n\nThe place looked worse than the photos suggested. The fog was real, thick enough that it pooled in low spots like something liquid. The hospital loomed beyond it, all those shattered windows like eye sockets in a skull. Someone had painted \"MEMENTO MORI\" across the main entrance in dripping red letters.\n\nMy breath came out in clouds. October in New England, the kind of cold that got into your bones and stayed there. I tried Ryan's phone. It went straight to voicemail. Casey's rang four times and went to her cheerful recording.\n\nI took a photo. Posted it to Instagram with the caption \"bad decisions loading...\" and watched it get three likes before I'd even pocketed my phone.\n\nHeadlights swept across the lot. Luke's Camaro, black and impractical, his dad's castoff. The engine ticked as it cooled. Luke climbed out first, Casey from the passenger side. She was wearing his letterman jacket over her hoodie, drowning in it.\n\n\"Jesus,\" Luke said, breath fogging. \"It's freezing. Remind me why we're doing this?\"\n\n\"Adventure,\" Casey said, but she'd lost some of that enthusiasm from earlier. She looked small in the empty parking lot, younger than usual.\n\n\"Ryan's not here yet,\" I said.\n\nLuke snorted. \"Probably chickened out.\"\n\nThen we heard the bike. Ryan came pedaling into the lot like he was being chased, skidding to a stop next to mine. His helmet was crooked, his face flushed red from cold and exertion.\n\n\"Where the hell were you?\" I asked. \"I called.\"\n\n\"Got lost,\" Ryan panted. \"No signal out here. Everything looks the same in the dark.\"\n\nCasey was staring at the hospital now, really looking at it. \"Maybe this is stupid,\" she said quietly. \"Maybe we should just go home.\"\n\n\"We drove all the way out here,\" Luke said. He was already walking toward the building, hands shoved in his jacket pockets. \"Come on.\"\n\nWe followed the fence line around to the back. Up close, the hospital felt worse. Bigger. More present. Like it was aware of us in some fundamental way. The windows on the ground floor were boarded over, but higher up they gaped open, and I kept expecting to see movement in them. A face. A hand.\n\nRyan was breathing too fast, that panicky rhythm that meant he was spiraling. I'd seen it before, usually during tests or when his mom called during school.\n\nThe forest pressed against the fence, trees so dense they looked solid. Pine and oak and something that made the air smell like decay. We found a spot where someone had cut the chain link and peeled it back like the lid on a can.\n\n\"So we're really doing this?\" Casey asked. Nobody answered.\n\nLuke went first, ducking through. Then Casey. Then me and Ryan, who looked like he was walking to his execution.\n\nThe forest was colder. That shouldn't have been possible, but it was. Our phone lights made narrow tunnels in the dark, catching on bark and exposed roots and something that might have been animal bones. We walked single file, nobody speaking. There was no path. Just trees and darkness and the sound of our breathing.\n\nFive minutes in, Luke stopped.\n\n\"This is stupid,\" he said. \"There's nothing here. Let's go back, check out the hospital instead.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Casey said quickly. \"The hospital. Better idea.\"\n\nWe turned around. That's when something moved in the trees behind us.\n\nHeavy. Deliberate. The sound of something large displacing air. Casey backed into Luke, grabbing his arm. Ryan had gone statue-still, and when I looked at him, his face had lost all color.\n\n\"Animal,\" Luke said, but his voice was wrong. Too high.\n\nThe thing moved again. Closer. And with it came a sound like wind chimes made of bone, a clicking rattle that made my teeth ache.\n\nIt stepped into the light.\n\nI want to tell you I processed what I was seeing. That my brain took in the details and categorized them in any useful way. But that's not what happened. What happened was my mind just stopped, like a computer program hitting a fatal error.\n\nSeven feet tall, maybe more. A shape that suggested a body but refused to confirm one. Draped in moss and forest rot, organic material that might have been fabric or flesh or something in between. And the head. God. A deer skull, bleached white, antlers spreading like broken fingers. Around its neck, strung on what looked like sinew, hung dozens of teeth. Human teeth, maybe. Or animal. The distinction seemed less important than the fact of their existence.\n\nIt had no eyes but I felt it looking at us. Looking into us.\n\nLuke made a sound I'd never heard him make before, something between a sob and a laugh.\n\nThe thing's jaw opened. Not like a jaw should, but hinging wrong, too wide, and when it spoke, the voice came from everywhere and nowhere. From inside my skull and from the ground and from the air itself.\n\n\"You come to wish.\"\n\nThe words scraped like rusted metal dragging across bone.\n\n\"All of you must wish.\"\n\nCasey was crying. I could hear it, small hitching sobs behind me, but I couldn't turn to look at her. Couldn't stop staring at the creature, at the way it seemed to shift and settle like it wasn't quite solid, wasn't quite real.\n\nThe skull twitched toward Ryan.\n\nRyan opened his mouth. Closed it. His hands were shaking so badly I could see it even in the bad light.\n\n\"Wish,\" the creature said, and its voice got louder, resonant, shaking the trees. \"WISH NOW.\"\n\n\"I wish,\" Ryan started, then stopped. His voice was barely a whisper. \"I wish to know if God is real.\"\n\nI don't know what I expected. Maybe nothing. Maybe for the thing to laugh or vanish or tell us we were all idiots playing with urban legends. But that's not what happened.\n\nThe creature convulsed. Its body, that shapeless mass, began twitching violently, and the deer skull lurched sideways at an angle that made my stomach turn. The bone necklace rattled in the opposite direction, spinning, and the sound it made was like grinding vertebrae.\n\nRyan screamed.\n\nNot a shout or a yell. A scream. The kind that carries agony and terror in equal measure, that sounds like someone being unmade at the molecular level. His hands shot to his head, fingers clawing at his skull, and then I saw it happen.\n\nHis head was collapsing inward.\n\nThe bones of his skull were folding like paper, caving in on themselves, and his face, Ryan's face, the one I'd known since we were twelve, was disappearing into the void it left behind. The skin went slack and then concave, and the scream cut off into something wet and horrible and then into nothing at all.\n\nHe hit the ground.\n\nCasey's scream replaced his, raw and primal. Luke grabbed her arm hard enough to bruise.\n\n\"Run,\" he said.\n\nWe ran.\n\nI crashed through a low hanging branch that whipped across my face, bark scraping my cheek raw. My phone was in my hand, light jerking wildly, turning the forest into a strobe nightmare of trees and shadows and nothing that made sense. Behind us, I could hear it. That rattling. Bone on bone, getting closer.\n\nCasey was sobbing as she ran, these gasping, hitching breaths between footfalls. Luke was ahead of her, pulling her by the wrist, and I was behind them both, and I couldn't stop thinking about Ryan. About the way his face had just collapsed, folded in on itself like wet cardboard.\n\nMy foot caught on a root and I went down hard, phone flying from my hand. The impact knocked the air from my lungs. I scrabbled in the dirt, fingers finding leaves and moss and something that felt horribly like bone before my hand closed around the phone.\n\nThe light was facing back the way we'd come.\n\nThe creature was there.\n\nNot far. Maybe twenty feet. Moving through the trees with that horrible fluid motion, branches bending around it like they were afraid to touch it. The deer skull was angled toward me, antlers scraping bark, and the bone necklace swayed and clattered with each movement.\n\nI could see details now that I hadn't before. The way the moss covering its body seemed to grow and shift, pulsing like something alive. The teeth on the necklace weren't all the same size. Some were small, child-sized. Others were long and pointed, predator teeth. And there were other things strung between them. Small bones. Finger bones maybe. And something that looked horrifyingly like a dried human ear.\n\n\"GET UP!\" Luke's voice, somewhere ahead in the darkness.\n\nI rolled onto my hands and knees, pushed myself up. My ankle screamed in protest but held. I ran.\n\nThe forest had become a maze. Every tree looked the same. Every shadow held something terrible. My lungs burned. The cold air felt like breathing broken glass. I could hear Luke and Casey ahead, crashing through undergrowth, and I pushed harder, trying to catch up.\n\nBehind me, that rattling never stopped. It stayed constant, rhythmic, like the creature was pacing itself. Like it knew it didn't need to rush. Like this was all part of something it had done a thousand times before.\n\nMy phone light caught Casey's jacket ahead, that bright red. I focused on it, used it as a beacon. We were running uphill now, the ground getting steeper, roots reaching across the path like fingers trying to trip us. My thighs burned. My ankle throbbed with each impact.\n\nThen Casey went down.\n\nShe cried out, a sharp yelp of pain, and Luke skidded to a stop. I nearly crashed into him. Casey was on the ground, clutching her leg, her phone a few feet away casting crazy shadows across her face.\n\n\"I can't,\" she gasped. \"My ankle, I can't.\"\n\nLuke looked back. Even in the bad light, I could see his face. The calculation happening there. The math of who lives and who dies.\n\n\"Help me get her up,\" I said, moving to Casey's other side.\n\nWe each took an arm, hauled her to her feet. She whimpered, tried to put weight on her right leg and nearly collapsed again. Luke and I locked our arms behind her back, made a kind of chair. She looped her arms around our necks.\n\nWe moved slower now. So much slower. Casey's weight between us, her breathing ragged in my ear. The creature's rattling got louder. Closer. I could feel its presence like a pressure change, like the air itself was being displaced by something too large, too wrong.\n\n\"There,\" Luke panted. \"I see the fence.\"\n\nAnd there it was, chain-link glinting in our phone lights, and beyond it, the dark mass of the hospital. We were coming at it from an angle, not the way we'd entered. This section of fence was intact but there was a spot maybe ten yards down where it had been peeled back.\n\nWe staggered toward it, Casey's weight making every step feel like we were wading through concrete. Five yards. Three.\n\nBehind us, branches cracked. Not the small pops of twigs breaking. The deep groan of something large pushing through resistance. I risked a look back.\n\nThe creature had closed the distance. It was right there, maybe fifteen feet away, and in the better light near the fence line I could see it clearly for the first time.\n\nIt wasn't wearing the moss and rot. That was its skin. Bark and organic material fused together into something that might have once been alive but had evolved past that into something else. The deer skull was partially embedded in its body, grown into it, and where the skull ended and the body began was impossible to determine. The antlers weren't antlers at all. They were bones. Human bones. Femurs and radius and ulna, all twisted and fused together into that branching structure.\n\nAnd the worst part, the part that made my bladder almost let go, was that the skull was moving. Not the creature's head, but the skull itself. The jaw was opening and closing in a rhythm that matched the rattling of the bone necklace, and I could see something behind the bone. Something dark and writhing, like the inside of the skull was full of worms or maggots or things that squirmed.\n\n\"Go, go, GO!\" I screamed.\n\nWe hit the fence line. Luke dropped Casey's arm, grabbed the peeled-back section and hauled it up. The metal shrieked. Casey went under first, on her hands and knees, crawling. I was right behind her, and behind me I could hear the creature moving faster now, could hear that rattling building to a crescendo.\n\nI was halfway under when I felt something grab my jacket. Not a hand. Nothing as simple as a hand. Something that felt like it had too many points of contact, like it was gripping me in six places at once. The fabric pulled taut, yanking me backward, and I screamed.\n\nCasey was on the other side, reaching back through, grabbing my arms. Luke was there too, pulling. I was caught between them, the fence cutting into my back, the creature's grip tightening. I could smell it now. Rot and earth and something sweet underneath, like decomposition, like meat going bad in the sun.\n\nMy jacket tore.\n\nThe sound was loud, that ripping canvas noise, and suddenly I was sliding forward, under the fence, Luke and Casey falling backward with me on top. We landed in a heap on the asphalt. I rolled, looked back.\n\nThe creature was pressed against the fence. Not trying to climb it or break through. Just standing there, that deer skull tilted, watching us. The bone necklace had gone still. In the parking lot lights, I could see my jacket, or what was left of it, hanging from one of the fence posts. It was shredded. Not cut. Shredded, like something with claws had grabbed it.\n\nBut the creature had no hands.\n\n\"Come on,\" Luke said, already pulling Casey to her feet. \"The hospital. We get inside, we're safe.\"\n\nI didn't know what made him think that. Didn't know what made him think we'd be safe anywhere. But the alternative was standing here in the parking lot while that thing watched us, so I got up and ran.\n\nThe hospital entrance gaped open. Someone had torn the boards off years ago. Inside was darkness, deeper than the forest, and that smell. Mold and decay and stale air that hadn't moved in decades. Our phones lit the way, catching on debris. A wheelchair, rusted, one wheel missing. Medical charts scattered across the floor, patient names still visible. An IV stand lying on its side.\n\nWe moved into the lobby, a wide open space with a reception desk that had been stripped of anything valuable. The floor was tile, broken in places, and our footsteps echoed wrong. Too loud. Like the building was paying attention.\n\n\"We can't stay here,\" Casey said. She was limping badly, putting almost no weight on her right leg. \"It'll come in. It'll find us.\"\n\n\"Then we go up,\" Luke said, gesturing to a stairwell on the far side of the lobby. \"Get to the second floor, find a room we can barricade.\"\n\n\"Or we go straight through,\" I said, pointing to a hallway that led deeper into the building. \"Find the other side, get back to the parking lot. Get to the car.\"\n\nLuke looked at Casey, then at me. I saw the decision forming. Saw the exact moment he chose.\n\n\"Through is faster,\" he said, already moving toward the hallway.\n\nWe followed. Casey between us again, hobbling, trying to keep up. The hallway was narrower than the lobby, doors lining both sides. Most were closed. Some hung open, revealing rooms full of stripped beds and broken equipment. Our phone lights made everything worse, turning shadows into threats, making every corner a potential ambush.\n\nWe passed a nurse's station. The desk was overturned, papers everywhere, and something had made a nest in the corner. I couldn't tell what. Blankets and trash and something else, something organic that I didn't want to look at too closely.\n\nThen we heard it behind us.\n\nThat rattling.\n\nInside the building now. In the lobby. The sound echoed off the walls, distorted, making it impossible to tell exactly where it was coming from. But it was close. Getting closer.\n\n\"Faster,\" Luke hissed.\n\nCasey was crying again, quiet sobs that she was trying to muffle. We were moving as fast as we could, but her ankle was bad, really bad, and each step was agony for her. I could feel it in the way she gripped my shoulder, nails digging in through my shirt.\n\nThe hallway branched. Luke took the left corridor without hesitating. We followed. This hallway was darker somehow, fewer windows, and the air felt thicker. Harder to breathe. Like the building's decay had concentrated here.\n\nBehind us, the rattling got louder. I risked a look back and saw nothing but darkness and the pathetic throw of our phone lights. But I could feel it. That presence. That wrongness.\n\n\"There,\" Luke said, pointing ahead.\n\nA door. Different from the others. Metal instead of wood, with a small window set at eye level. Emergency exit, maybe. A way out. We stumbled toward it, Casey whimpering with each step, and Luke hit it at full speed.\n\nIt didn't budge.\n\nHe slammed into it, bounced back, tried the handle. Locked. He threw his shoulder against it again, and again, and the door rattled in its frame but held.\n\n\"Fuck,\" he said. \"Fuck, fuck, FUCK.\"\n\nThe rattling was louder now. So loud it seemed to come from the walls themselves. I turned, putting myself between Casey and the direction we'd come, and my phone light caught movement at the end of the hallway.\n\nThe creature was there.\n\nIt had to hunch to fit in the corridor, that deer skull scraping the ceiling tiles. Bits of acoustic foam rained down as it moved, and the sound of its passage was wrong. Wet and grinding, like meat being forced through a space too small.\n\n\"Luke,\" I said, and my voice was surprisingly steady. \"We need to move.\"\n\n\"The door's locked!\"\n\n\"Then we find another door!\"\n\nLuke grabbed Casey's arm and pulled her away from the exit. We ran back the way we'd come, but the creature was blocking that path now, so we took the first door we came to. It opened into a patient room, and we slammed it shut behind us.\n\nThe room was small. A single bed, stripped to the frame. A window with bars on it, glass long gone, letting in cold air and the smell of the forest. A small bathroom in the corner, door hanging off one hinge.\n\n\"We're trapped,\" Casey said. She'd given up trying to stop crying. Tears tracked down her face, catching in our phone lights. \"We're trapped and it's going to kill us.\"\n\n\"There has to be another way out,\" I said, moving to the window. The bars were solid, old but not rusted enough to break. I shook them anyway. They didn't move.\n\nBehind us, in the hallway, the rattling had stopped.\n\nThe silence was worse. So much worse. Because silence meant it was listening. Hunting. Planning.\n\nLuke was at the door, ear pressed against it, trying to hear movement. His hand was on the handle, knuckles white.\n\n\"I don't hear anything,\" he whispered.\n\n\"That doesn't mean it's not there,\" Casey said.\n\nWe waited. Seconds that felt like hours. My heart was beating so hard I could feel it in my throat, in my temples. The cold air from the window made me shiver, or maybe that was just fear. Probably fear.\n\nThen something scraped against the door.\n\nNot a knock. A long, drawn-out scrape, like bone on metal. The door shuddered. Luke jumped back, nearly dropping his phone.\n\nThe scraping came again, lower this time. Then higher. Like the thing was testing the door, learning its dimensions.\n\nThe handle started to turn.\n\nLuke grabbed it, tried to hold it, but the force on the other side was immense. The handle turned despite his grip, despite him throwing his weight against it, and the door began to open.\n\n\"Help me!\" Luke screamed.\n\nI ran to the door, added my weight. Casey was there too, her bad ankle forgotten, all of us pressing against the door as it slowly, inexorably, opened. It was like trying to hold back a freight train. Like trying to stop gravity.\n\nThe door opened six inches. Then a foot. Through the gap, I could see the hallway, and I could see the creature.\n\nIt had changed. Or maybe I was just seeing it more clearly. The deer skull was at ground level now, and I realized the creature didn't have a fixed orientation. It could move in any direction, could reorient itself however it needed. The skull was sideways now, antlers scraping the doorframe, and behind it, that body of moss and rot and wrong, and in the darkness behind the skull's eye sockets, I saw movement. Saw things writhing.\n\nThe door opened another foot.\n\n\"The bathroom!\" Casey screamed. \"Go, go!\"\n\nWe broke, all of us at once, abandoning the door and sprinting for the bathroom. It was tiny, barely enough room for the three of us, but we crammed inside and Luke grabbed the door. This one was lighter, flimsier, but it had a lock. He turned it just as the patient room door slammed open behind us.\n\nThe creature filled the doorway.\n\nThrough the crack at the bottom of the bathroom door, I could see it. Could see that mass of organic material spreading across the tile, and the shadow it cast was wrong. Too many angles. Too much depth.\n\nThen came the voice.\n\n\"Wish,\" it said, and the word rattled through the building. \"Must wish. All must wish.\"\n\nLuke's face was white. He was backed against the sink, hands gripping the porcelain like it was the only thing keeping him upright. Casey was in the corner, arms wrapped around herself, rocking slightly.\n\nThe door shuddered. Something hit it, heavy, and the wood cracked.\n\n\"Wish,\" the creature said again. \"You. Wish. NOW.\"\n\nThe door splintered. Wood shards exploded inward. A piece hit my arm, drawing blood. Through the hole in the door, I could see the deer skull, could see those empty sockets looking in at us.\n\nLuke's voice came out strangled, desperate.\n\n\"I wish you were dead,\" he said. \"I wish you were fucking dead.\"\n\nThe creature's response was immediate. The deer skull snapped back, and that rattling started again, frenzied, and Luke's hands flew to his back.\n\nHe screamed.\n\nNot like Ryan. Different. This was a scream of confusion more than pain, at least at first. Then the pain came. I watched his body arch backward, watched his shirt collapse inward like something was being pulled out from underneath, and I understood.\n\nThe creature was removing his spine.\n\nNot all at once. Bone by bone. Vertebra by vertebra. I could see them going, could see the shirt fabric cave where each bone disappeared. Luke's body bent backward, farther than any body should bend, and the scream went on and on until his lungs couldn't support it anymore and it became a wet gurgle.\n\nThen he fell.\n\nCasey was screaming. Had been screaming. I grabbed her, pulled her close, but she fought me. Pushed me away.\n\n\"No!\" she shouted at the creature. At the deer skull watching us through the broken door. \"I wish none of this ever happened! I wish we never came here!\"\n\nAnd the world broke.\n\nThat's the only way I can describe it. Reality fractured like glass, and through the cracks I could see something else. Other versions of this moment. Other timelines where we made different choices. Where we didn't come. Where we turned back. Where Ryan said something else. All of them existing simultaneously, overlapping, bleeding into each other.\n\nThe buzzing started in my skull, building and building until I thought my head would explode. The bathroom walls rippled like water. Casey was there and then not there and then there again, flickering like a broken film strip. The creature's rattling became a roar, became everything, became the only sound in existence.\n\nI fell.\n\nOr flew.\n\nOr both.\n\nTime inverted. Collapsed. Expanded. I saw Ryan's face caving in again but backward, saw it inflate like a balloon. Saw Luke's spine returning, then disappearing again. Saw Casey running, screaming, laughing, all at the same time.\n\nThen it stopped.\n\nComplete silence. Complete stillness.\n\nI was on my back, staring up at nothing. No, not nothing. Stars. I was staring at stars. My hands were on asphalt, cold and rough. I sat up slowly, carefully, like any sudden movement might shatter whatever fragile reality had formed around me.\n\nI was in the parking lot.\n\nNot near it. In it. Lying next to Luke's Camaro. The driver's side door hung open. The dome light was on, casting everything in sickly yellow.\n\nI stood. My legs shook but held. I turned slowly, taking it in. The parking lot. The hospital in the distance. The forest pressing against the fence line.\n\nAnd Luke's car.\n\nI knew before I looked. Somehow I knew. But I looked anyway.\n\nLuke was in the driver's seat. Slumped over the steering wheel, his body bent at an angle that was only possible because there was nothing inside to stop it bending that way. His shirt had collapsed inward, empty, and even from outside the car I could see the void where his spine should have been.\n\nI made a sound. Not quite a scream. Not quite a sob. Something in between.\n\nI walked around to the passenger side on legs that didn't feel like mine. Opened the door with hands that had forgotten how to shake.\n\nCasey was there.\n\nFolded in on herself like origami. Her torso compressed, caved in, her body bent over her knees in a way that revealed the complete absence of ribs. Her ribcage was gone. Removed. Taken as payment.\n\nHer head rested on the dashboard, eyes open but not seeing. Not anymore.\n\nI closed the door carefully. Gently. Like she might wake up if I made too much noise.\n\nRyan's bike was still there. Still propped against the light pole where he'd left it.\n\nRyan was next to it.\n\nI couldn't look at him. Not directly. My eyes skated away from what was left of his face, from the collapsed ruin of his skull. But I saw enough. I saw the bike visible through where his head used to be. Saw the way his body looked boneless, deflated.\n\nI sat down in the parking lot. Right there on the cold asphalt. And I laughed. Not because anything was funny. Just because something had to come out and laughter was what my body chose. It turned into crying pretty quickly. Then back to laughing. Then I couldn't tell which one I was doing anymore.\n\nEventually, I called 911.\n\nTold them there'd been an accident at County Memorial. They asked what kind of accident and I said, \"You need to come. Please just come.\"\n\nThe cops arrived first. Then the ambulances. Then more cops. They separated me from the bodies, wrapped me in a foil blanket, asked questions I couldn't answer. What happened? Where were you? What did you see?\n\nI told them the truth. All of it. The creature. The wishes. The hospital.\n\nThey wrote it down with the kind of careful attention people give the clearly insane.\n\nBy morning, I was in the back of a police car. By afternoon, I was in a psychiatric ward.\n\nThey were kind. That's what made it worse. Everyone so gentle, so understanding. Asking me about what I'd experienced, nodding when I talked about the creature, taking careful notes. The medications came in little cups, pills that made everything feel distant and manageable.\n\n\"It was a psychotic break,\" the doctor told me after the first week. \"Trauma manifesting as hallucination. You survived something terrible and your mind created a narrative to cope.\"\n\nI learned to agree with him. Learned to say the right things, to show the right amount of progress. Three months of good behavior, of taking the pills, of going to group therapy and pretending I believed what they believed.\n\nThen they approved an outing. A supervised trip back into the world.\n\n\"We think you're ready,\" the doctor said. \"Ready to reintegrate.\"\n\nI know where I'm going.\n\nI know what I'll do.\n\nThe creature said we all had to wish. Ryan did. Luke did. Casey did. But I never made mine. The creature is still waiting. It has to be. Those are the rules.\n\nI'll go back to those woods. I'll find it in the darkness between the trees. And I'll say the words that have been circling in my head for three months, the only wish that makes sense now.\n\nMaybe it won't work. Maybe the creature is gone, maybe the rules don't function that way, maybe I'm just crazy after all and I'll wander those woods until I die of exposure.\n\nBut I have to try.\n\nBecause this, right here, breathing and walking and pretending to be alive while they're in the ground, this is the real horror. This is the real price.\n\nAnd tomorrow, I'm going to pay it.",

    "content": "The thing about Ryan was that he never committed to anything scary. Horror movies were out. Roller coasters were out. Even choosing colleges stressed him out because it meant closing doors, making something real and final. His therapist called it 'decision paralysis.' I called it self-preservation. When your dad walks out and your mom stops getting out of bed, you learn that some questions are better left unasked.\n\nI understood that. Ryan's mom had the kind of depression that kept the curtains drawn for weeks at a time. His dad left when Ryan was eleven, and the last thing the guy said before walking out was that Ryan needed to \"man up and help your mother.\" So Ryan learned to be quiet. To fade into the background of rooms. To make himself small enough that his presence wouldn't be another burden for anyone to carry.\n\nCasey was the opposite. She took up space like she'd been told her whole life she deserved to. Student council, debate team, Instagram aesthetic so carefully curated it looked effortless. Her parents were the kind of people who showed up to every event with professional cameras, who had her entire academic future mapped out on a literal poster board in their home office. Yale, then law school, then partnership in her father's firm.\n\nThe thing was, Casey actually wanted none of that. She'd told me once, sophomore year, that she wished she could just work in a plant nursery. Spend her days with her hands in dirt, helping things grow. But she'd said it like it was a joke, like the idea of disappointing her parents was so unthinkable it could only exist as fantasy.\n\nAnd Luke. Luke was more complicated than I wanted him to be.\n\nHe was tall, yeah. Played varsity football. Had the kind of easy confidence that came from never being told he couldn't do something. But here's the thing nobody else seemed to notice: Luke's dad hit him. Not often enough to leave marks that lasted, but enough. I'd seen Luke flinch once when Ryan clapped him on the shoulder too suddenly. Seen the way he stood sometimes, favoring his left side like his ribs were sore. He never talked about it, and I never asked, but it was there between us like smoke.\n\nThat's why he cheated on Casey, probably. Self-sabotage as a kind of protection. If you ruin it first, nobody can take it from you. I understood the logic even if I hated what it did to her. Even if watching her take him back felt like watching someone walk into traffic.\n\nMe? I was just trying to get through high school without my own damage becoming everyone else's problem.\n\nThe folklore started on a Reddit thread. Someone's uncle's coworker knew a guy who'd gone into the woods behind County Memorial and come back wrong. Different. Kept talking about prices and payments and how everything cost something. Three weeks later, he drove his truck into the lake with his whole family inside.\n\n\"It's bullshit,\" Ryan had said when Casey first brought it up, but his fingers were already drumming that nervous pattern on his knee. The one that meant he was thinking about it too hard, letting it get under his skin.\n\n\"Probably,\" Casey said. She was scrolling through satellite images of the hospital on her phone, zooming in on the forest that pressed against its southern edge. \"But wouldn't it be cool to check out? Just the hospital, I mean. Urban exploration.\"\n\nThe hospital had been abandoned since 2003. County Memorial, built in the forties, shut down after some Medicare fraud thing bankrupted the board. Six stories of brick and broken windows, wrapped in chain-link and covered in the kind of graffiti that suggested people came here specifically to be forgotten. The forest beyond it was old growth pine, dense enough that hikers got lost every few years. Search parties, helicopters, the whole production. Sometimes they found the bodies.\n\nWe were standing by Casey's locker between third and fourth period when she pitched the idea. Ryan looked like he wanted to crawl into the ventilation system. I was trying to figure out how to say no without sounding as scared as I felt when Luke appeared.\n\nHe had this way of moving through crowds like they were designed to part for him. People just stepped aside. He came up behind Casey and wrapped his arms around her waist, lifting her off her feet. She shrieked, kicking her legs, laughing in that way that made my stomach hurt.\n\n\"What are we talking about?\" Luke asked, setting her down.\n\nCasey turned in his arms, already grinning. \"The hospital. The one with the woods out back. We're thinking of exploring it.\"\n\n\"Sounds boring,\" Luke said, but he was looking at me when he said it, one eyebrow raised. \"Unless you're afraid.\"\n\nThere it was. The hook. Luke knew exactly what he was doing. He'd been doing it since middle school, this casual needling that made saying no feel like admitting weakness. It was manipulative and obvious and it worked anyway because I was seventeen and stupid.\n\n\"Tonight,\" I said. \"Seven o'clock.\"\n\nLuke smiled. Ryan looked like he might throw up.\n\nI told my parents I was sleeping at Ryan's. They barely looked up from their respective screens. My dad worked in insurance, my mom taught elementary school, and both of them seemed relieved I had friends to occupy my time. Teenagers were a mystery they'd decided not to solve.\n\nI climbed out my bedroom window at six thirty, dropping into the backyard with an impact that made my ankles ache. My bike was old, inherited from a cousin, and the chain made a clicking sound that seemed too loud in the quiet suburban evening. I texted Ryan that I was heading out. He sent back a thumbs up and nothing else.\n\nThe hospital was four miles away, past the nice part of town and into the part where houses had bars on the windows. The sun was setting, turning the sky the color of a bruise. By the time I reached the parking lot, full dark had fallen.\n\nThe place looked worse than the photos suggested. The fog was real, thick enough that it pooled in low spots like something liquid. The hospital loomed beyond it, all those shattered windows like eye sockets in a skull. Someone had painted \"MEMENTO MORI\" across the main entrance in dripping red letters.\n\nMy breath came out in clouds. October in New England, the kind of cold that got into your bones and stayed there. I tried Ryan's phone. It went straight to voicemail. Casey's rang four times and went to her cheerful recording.\n\nI took a photo. Posted it to Instagram with the caption \"bad decisions loading...\" and watched it get three likes before I'd even pocketed my phone.\n\nHeadlights swept across the lot. Luke's Camaro, black and impractical, his dad's castoff. The engine ticked as it cooled. Luke climbed out first, Casey from the passenger side. She was wearing his letterman jacket over her hoodie, drowning in it.\n\n\"Jesus,\" Luke said, breath fogging. \"It's freezing. Remind me why we're doing this?\"\n\n\"Adventure,\" Casey said, but she'd lost some of that enthusiasm from earlier. She looked small in the empty parking lot, younger than usual.\n\n\"Ryan's not here yet,\" I said.\n\nLuke snorted. \"Probably chickened out.\"\n\nThen we heard the bike. Ryan came pedaling into the lot like he was being chased, skidding to a stop next to mine. His helmet was crooked, his face flushed red from cold and exertion.\n\n\"Where the hell were you?\" I asked. \"I called.\"\n\n\"Got lost,\" Ryan panted. \"No signal out here. Everything looks the same in the dark.\"\n\nCasey was staring at the hospital now, really looking at it. \"Maybe this is stupid,\" she said quietly. \"Maybe we should just go home.\"\n\n\"We drove all the way out here,\" Luke said. He was already walking toward the building, hands shoved in his jacket pockets. \"Come on.\"\n\nWe followed the fence line around to the back. Up close, the hospital felt worse. Bigger. More present. Like it was aware of us in some fundamental way. The windows on the ground floor were boarded over, but higher up they gaped open, and I kept expecting to see movement in them. A face. A hand.\n\nRyan was breathing too fast, that panicky rhythm that meant he was spiraling. I'd seen it before, usually during tests or when his mom called during school.\n\nThe forest pressed against the fence, trees so dense they looked solid. Pine and oak and something that made the air smell like decay. We found a spot where someone had cut the chain link and peeled it back like the lid on a can.\n\n\"So we're really doing this?\" Casey asked. Nobody answered.\n\nLuke went first, ducking through. Then Casey. Then me and Ryan, who looked like he was walking to his execution.\n\nThe forest was colder. That shouldn't have been possible, but it was. Our phone lights made narrow tunnels in the dark, catching on bark and exposed roots and something that might have been animal bones. We walked single file, nobody speaking. There was no path. Just trees and darkness and the sound of our breathing.\n\nFive minutes in, Luke stopped.\n\n\"This is stupid,\" he said. \"There's nothing here. Let's go back, check out the hospital instead.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Casey said quickly. \"The hospital. Better idea.\"\n\nWe turned around. That's when something moved in the trees behind us.\n\nHeavy. Deliberate. The sound of something large displacing air. Casey backed into Luke, grabbing his arm. Ryan had gone statue-still, and when I looked at him, his face had lost all color.\n\n\"Animal,\" Luke said, but his voice was wrong. Too high.\n\nThe thing moved again. Closer. And with it came a sound like wind chimes made of bone, a clicking rattle that made my teeth ache.\n\nIt stepped into the light.\n\nI want to tell you I processed what I was seeing. That my brain took in the details and categorized them in any useful way. But that's not what happened. What happened was my mind just stopped, like a computer program hitting a fatal error.\n\nSeven feet tall, maybe more. A shape that suggested a body but refused to confirm one. Draped in moss and forest rot, organic material that might have been fabric or flesh or something in between. And the head. God. A deer skull, bleached white, antlers spreading like broken fingers. Around its neck, strung on what looked like sinew, hung dozens of teeth. Human teeth, maybe. Or animal. The distinction seemed less important than the fact of their existence.\n\nIt had no eyes but I felt it looking at us. Looking into us.\n\nLuke made a sound I'd never heard him make before, something between a sob and a laugh.\n\nThe thing's jaw opened. Not like a jaw should, but hinging wrong, too wide, and when it spoke, the voice came from everywhere and nowhere. From inside my skull and from the ground and from the air itself.\n\n\"You come to wish.\"\n\nThe words scraped like rusted metal dragging across bone.\n\n\"All of you must wish.\"\n\nCasey was crying. I could hear it, small hitching sobs behind me, but I couldn't turn to look at her. Couldn't stop staring at the creature, at the way it seemed to shift and settle like it wasn't quite solid, wasn't quite real.\n\nThe skull twitched toward Ryan.\n\nRyan opened his mouth. Closed it. His hands were shaking so badly I could see it even in the bad light.\n\n\"Wish,\" the creature said, and its voice got louder, resonant, shaking the trees. \"WISH NOW.\"\n\n\"I wish,\" Ryan started, then stopped. His voice was barely a whisper. \"I wish to know if God is real.\"\n\nI don't know what I expected. Maybe nothing. Maybe for the thing to laugh or vanish or tell us we were all idiots playing with urban legends. But that's not what happened.\n\nThe creature convulsed. Its body, that shapeless mass, began twitching violently, and the deer skull lurched sideways at an angle that made my stomach turn. The bone necklace rattled in the opposite direction, spinning, and the sound it made was like grinding vertebrae.\n\nRyan screamed.\n\nNot a shout or a yell. A scream. The kind that carries agony and terror in equal measure, that sounds like someone being unmade at the molecular level. His hands shot to his head, fingers clawing at his skull, and then I saw it happen.\n\nHis head was collapsing inward.\n\nThe bones of his skull were folding like paper, caving in on themselves, and his face, Ryan's face, the one I'd known since we were twelve, was disappearing into the void it left behind. The skin went slack and then concave, and the scream cut off into something wet and horrible and then into nothing at all.\n\nHe hit the ground.\n\nCasey's scream replaced his, raw and primal. Luke grabbed her arm hard enough to bruise.\n\n\"Run,\" he said.\n\nWe ran.\n\nI crashed through a low hanging branch that whipped across my face, bark scraping my cheek raw. My phone was in my hand, light jerking wildly, turning the forest into a strobe nightmare of trees and shadows and nothing that made sense. Behind us, I could hear it. That rattling. Bone on bone, getting closer.\n\nCasey was sobbing as she ran, these gasping, hitching breaths between footfalls. Luke was ahead of her, pulling her by the wrist, and I was behind them both, and I couldn't stop thinking about Ryan. About the way his face had just collapsed, folded in on itself like wet cardboard.\n\nMy foot caught on a root and I went down hard, phone flying from my hand. The impact knocked the air from my lungs. I scrabbled in the dirt, fingers finding leaves and moss and something that felt horribly like bone before my hand closed around the phone.\n\nThe light was facing back the way we'd come.\n\nThe creature was there.\n\nNot far. Maybe twenty feet. Moving through the trees with that horrible fluid motion, branches bending around it like they were afraid to touch it. The deer skull was angled toward me, antlers scraping bark, and the bone necklace swayed and clattered with each movement.\n\nI could see details now that I hadn't before. The way the moss covering its body seemed to grow and shift, pulsing like something alive. The teeth on the necklace weren't all the same size. Some were small, child-sized. Others were long and pointed, predator teeth. And there were other things strung between them. Small bones. Finger bones maybe. And something that looked horrifyingly like a dried human ear.\n\n\"GET UP!\" Luke's voice, somewhere ahead in the darkness.\n\nI rolled onto my hands and knees, pushed myself up. My ankle screamed in protest but held. I ran.\n\nThe forest had become a maze. Every tree looked the same. Every shadow held something terrible. My lungs burned. The cold air felt like breathing broken glass. I could hear Luke and Casey ahead, crashing through undergrowth, and I pushed harder, trying to catch up.\n\nBehind me, that rattling never stopped. It stayed constant, rhythmic, like the creature was pacing itself. Like it knew it didn't need to rush. Like this was all part of something it had done a thousand times before.\n\nMy phone light caught Casey's jacket ahead, that bright red. I focused on it, used it as a beacon. We were running uphill now, the ground getting steeper, roots reaching across the path like fingers trying to trip us. My thighs burned. My ankle throbbed with each impact.\n\nThen Casey went down.\n\nShe cried out, a sharp yelp of pain, and Luke skidded to a stop. I nearly crashed into him. Casey was on the ground, clutching her leg, her phone a few feet away casting crazy shadows across her face.\n\n\"I can't,\" she gasped. \"My ankle, I can't.\"\n\nLuke looked back. Even in the bad light, I could see his face. The calculation happening there. The math of who lives and who dies.\n\n\"Help me get her up,\" I said, moving to Casey's other side.\n\nWe each took an arm, hauled her to her feet. She whimpered, tried to put weight on her right leg and nearly collapsed again. Luke and I locked our arms behind her back, made a kind of chair. She looped her arms around our necks.\n\nWe moved slower now. So much slower. Casey's weight between us, her breathing ragged in my ear. The creature's rattling got louder. Closer. I could feel its presence like a pressure change, like the air itself was being displaced by something too large, too wrong.\n\n\"There,\" Luke panted. \"I see the fence.\"\n\nAnd there it was, chain-link glinting in our phone lights, and beyond it, the dark mass of the hospital. We were coming at it from an angle, not the way we'd entered. This section of fence was intact but there was a spot maybe ten yards down where it had been peeled back.\n\nWe staggered toward it, Casey's weight making every step feel like we were wading through concrete. Five yards. Three.\n\nBehind us, branches cracked. Not the small pops of twigs breaking. The deep groan of something large pushing through resistance. I risked a look back.\n\nThe creature had closed the distance. It was right there, maybe fifteen feet away, and in the better light near the fence line I could see it clearly for the first time.\n\nIt wasn't wearing the moss and rot. That was its skin. Bark and organic material fused together into something that might have once been alive but had evolved past that into something else. The deer skull was partially embedded in its body, grown into it, and where the skull ended and the body began was impossible to determine. The antlers weren't antlers at all. They were bones. Human bones. Femurs and radius and ulna, all twisted and fused together into that branching structure.\n\nAnd the worst part, the part that made my bladder almost let go, was that the skull was moving. Not the creature's head, but the skull itself. The jaw was opening and closing in a rhythm that matched the rattling of the bone necklace, and I could see something behind the bone. Something dark and writhing, like the inside of the skull was full of worms or maggots or things that squirmed.\n\n\"Go, go, GO!\" I screamed.\n\nWe hit the fence line. Luke dropped Casey's arm, grabbed the peeled-back section and hauled it up. The metal shrieked. Casey went under first, on her hands and knees, crawling. I was right behind her, and behind me I could hear the creature moving faster now, could hear that rattling building to a crescendo.\n\nI was halfway under when I felt something grab my jacket. Not a hand. Nothing as simple as a hand. Something that felt like it had too many points of contact, like it was gripping me in six places at once. The fabric pulled taut, yanking me backward, and I screamed.\n\nCasey was on the other side, reaching back through, grabbing my arms. Luke was there too, pulling. I was caught between them, the fence cutting into my back, the creature's grip tightening. I could smell it now. Rot and earth and something sweet underneath, like decomposition, like meat going bad in the sun.\n\nMy jacket tore.\n\nThe sound was loud, that ripping canvas noise, and suddenly I was sliding forward, under the fence, Luke and Casey falling backward with me on top. We landed in a heap on the asphalt. I rolled, looked back.\n\nThe creature was pressed against the fence. Not trying to climb it or break through. Just standing there, that deer skull tilted, watching us. The bone necklace had gone still. In the parking lot lights, I could see my jacket, or what was left of it, hanging from one of the fence posts. It was shredded. Not cut. Shredded, like something with claws had grabbed it.\n\nBut the creature had no hands.\n\n\"Come on,\" Luke said, already pulling Casey to her feet. \"The hospital. We get inside, we're safe.\"\n\nI didn't know what made him think that. Didn't know what made him think we'd be safe anywhere. But the alternative was standing here in the parking lot while that thing watched us, so I got up and ran.\n\nThe hospital entrance gaped open. Someone had torn the boards off years ago. Inside was darkness, deeper than the forest, and that smell. Mold and decay and stale air that hadn't moved in decades. Our phones lit the way, catching on debris. A wheelchair, rusted, one wheel missing. Medical charts scattered across the floor, patient names still visible. An IV stand lying on its side.\n\nWe moved into the lobby, a wide open space with a reception desk that had been stripped of anything valuable. The floor was tile, broken in places, and our footsteps echoed wrong. Too loud. Like the building was paying attention.\n\n\"We can't stay here,\" Casey said. She was limping badly, putting almost no weight on her right leg. \"It'll come in. It'll find us.\"\n\n\"Then we go up,\" Luke said, gesturing to a stairwell on the far side of the lobby. \"Get to the second floor, find a room we can barricade.\"\n\n\"Or we go straight through,\" I said, pointing to a hallway that led deeper into the building. \"Find the other side, get back to the parking lot. Get to the car.\"\n\nLuke looked at Casey, then at me. I saw the decision forming. Saw the exact moment he chose.\n\n\"Through is faster,\" he said, already moving toward the hallway.\n\nWe followed. Casey between us again, hobbling, trying to keep up. The hallway was narrower than the lobby, doors lining both sides. Most were closed. Some hung open, revealing rooms full of stripped beds and broken equipment. Our phone lights made everything worse, turning shadows into threats, making every corner a potential ambush.\n\nWe passed a nurse's station. The desk was overturned, papers everywhere, and something had made a nest in the corner. I couldn't tell what. Blankets and trash and something else, something organic that I didn't want to look at too closely.\n\nThen we heard it behind us.\n\nThat rattling.\n\nInside the building now. In the lobby. The sound echoed off the walls, distorted, making it impossible to tell exactly where it was coming from. But it was close. Getting closer.\n\n\"Faster,\" Luke hissed.\n\nCasey was crying again, quiet sobs that she was trying to muffle. We were moving as fast as we could, but her ankle was bad, really bad, and each step was agony for her. I could feel it in the way she gripped my shoulder, nails digging in through my shirt.\n\nThe hallway branched. Luke took the left corridor without hesitating. We followed. This hallway was darker somehow, fewer windows, and the air felt thicker. Harder to breathe. Like the building's decay had concentrated here.\n\nBehind us, the rattling got louder. I risked a look back and saw nothing but darkness and the pathetic throw of our phone lights. But I could feel it. That presence. That wrongness.\n\n\"There,\" Luke said, pointing ahead.\n\nA door. Different from the others. Metal instead of wood, with a small window set at eye level. Emergency exit, maybe. A way out. We stumbled toward it, Casey whimpering with each step, and Luke hit it at full speed.\n\nIt didn't budge.\n\nHe slammed into it, bounced back, tried the handle. Locked. He threw his shoulder against it again, and again, and the door rattled in its frame but held.\n\n\"Fuck,\" he said. \"Fuck, fuck, FUCK.\"\n\nThe rattling was louder now. So loud it seemed to come from the walls themselves. I turned, putting myself between Casey and the direction we'd come, and my phone light caught movement at the end of the hallway.\n\nThe creature was there.\n\nIt had to hunch to fit in the corridor, that deer skull scraping the ceiling tiles. Bits of acoustic foam rained down as it moved, and the sound of its passage was wrong. Wet and grinding, like meat being forced through a space too small.\n\n\"Luke,\" I said, and my voice was surprisingly steady. \"We need to move.\"\n\n\"The door's locked!\"\n\n\"Then we find another door!\"\n\nLuke grabbed Casey's arm and pulled her away from the exit. We ran back the way we'd come, but the creature was blocking that path now, so we took the first door we came to. It opened into a patient room, and we slammed it shut behind us.\n\nThe room was small. A single bed, stripped to the frame. A window with bars on it, glass long gone, letting in cold air and the smell of the forest. A small bathroom in the corner, door hanging off one hinge.\n\n\"We're trapped,\" Casey said. She'd given up trying to stop crying. Tears tracked down her face, catching in our phone lights. \"We're trapped and it's going to kill us.\"\n\n\"There has to be another way out,\" I said, moving to the window. The bars were solid, old but not rusted enough to break. I shook them anyway. They didn't move.\n\nBehind us, in the hallway, the rattling had stopped.\n\nThe silence was worse. So much worse. Because silence meant it was listening. Hunting. Planning.\n\nLuke was at the door, ear pressed against it, trying to hear movement. His hand was on the handle, knuckles white.\n\n\"I don't hear anything,\" he whispered.\n\n\"That doesn't mean it's not there,\" Casey said.\n\nWe waited. Seconds that felt like hours. My heart was beating so hard I could feel it in my throat, in my temples. The cold air from the window made me shiver, or maybe that was just fear. Probably fear.\n\nThen something scraped against the door.\n\nNot a knock. A long, drawn-out scrape, like bone on metal. The door shuddered. Luke jumped back, nearly dropping his phone.\n\nThe scraping came again, lower this time. Then higher. Like the thing was testing the door, learning its dimensions.\n\nThe handle started to turn.\n\nLuke grabbed it, tried to hold it, but the force on the other side was immense. The handle turned despite his grip, despite him throwing his weight against it, and the door began to open.\n\n\"Help me!\" Luke screamed.\n\nI ran to the door, added my weight. Casey was there too, her bad ankle forgotten, all of us pressing against the door as it slowly, inexorably, opened. It was like trying to hold back a freight train. Like trying to stop gravity.\n\nThe door opened six inches. Then a foot. Through the gap, I could see the hallway, and I could see the creature.\n\nIt had changed. Or maybe I was just seeing it more clearly. The deer skull was at ground level now, and I realized the creature didn't have a fixed orientation. It could move in any direction, could reorient itself however it needed. The skull was sideways now, antlers scraping the doorframe, and behind it, that body of moss and rot and wrong, and in the darkness behind the skull's eye sockets, I saw movement. Saw things writhing.\n\nThe door opened another foot.\n\n\"The bathroom!\" Casey screamed. \"Go, go!\"\n\nWe broke, all of us at once, abandoning the door and sprinting for the bathroom. It was tiny, barely enough room for the three of us, but we crammed inside and Luke grabbed the door. This one was lighter, flimsier, but it had a lock. He turned it just as the patient room door slammed open behind us.\n\nThe creature filled the doorway.\n\nThrough the crack at the bottom of the bathroom door, I could see it. Could see that mass of organic material spreading across the tile, and the shadow it cast was wrong. Too many angles. Too much depth.\n\nThen came the voice.\n\n\"Wish,\" it said, and the word rattled through the building. \"Must wish. All must wish.\"\n\nLuke's face was white. He was backed against the sink, hands gripping the porcelain like it was the only thing keeping him upright. Casey was in the corner, arms wrapped around herself, rocking slightly.\n\nThe door shuddered. Something hit it, heavy, and the wood cracked.\n\n\"Wish,\" the creature said again. \"You. Wish. NOW.\"\n\nThe door splintered. Wood shards exploded inward. A piece hit my arm, drawing blood. Through the hole in the door, I could see the deer skull, could see those empty sockets looking in at us.\n\nLuke's voice came out strangled, desperate.\n\n\"I wish you were dead,\" he said. \"I wish you were fucking dead.\"\n\nThe creature's response was immediate. The deer skull snapped back, and that rattling started again, frenzied, and Luke's hands flew to his back.\n\nHe screamed.\n\nNot like Ryan. Different. This was a scream of confusion more than pain, at least at first. Then the pain came. I watched his body arch backward, watched his shirt collapse inward like something was being pulled out from underneath, and I understood.\n\nThe creature was removing his spine.\n\nNot all at once. Bone by bone. Vertebra by vertebra. I could see them going, could see the shirt fabric cave where each bone disappeared. Luke's body bent backward, farther than any body should bend, and the scream went on and on until his lungs couldn't support it anymore and it became a wet gurgle.\n\nThen he fell.\n\nCasey was screaming. Had been screaming. I grabbed her, pulled her close, but she fought me. Pushed me away.\n\n\"No!\" she shouted at the creature. At the deer skull watching us through the broken door. \"I wish none of this ever happened! I wish we never came here!\"\n\nAnd the world broke.\n\nThat's the only way I can describe it. Reality fractured like glass, and through the cracks I could see something else. Other versions of this moment. Other timelines where we made different choices. Where we didn't come. Where we turned back. Where Ryan said something else. All of them existing simultaneously, overlapping, bleeding into each other.\n\nThe buzzing started in my skull, building and building until I thought my head would explode. The bathroom walls rippled like water. Casey was there and then not there and then there again, flickering like a broken film strip. The creature's rattling became a roar, became everything, became the only sound in existence.\n\nI fell.\n\nOr flew.\n\nOr both.\n\nTime inverted. Collapsed. Expanded. I saw Ryan's face caving in again but backward, saw it inflate like a balloon. Saw Luke's spine returning, then disappearing again. Saw Casey running, screaming, laughing, all at the same time.\n\nThen it stopped.\n\nComplete silence. Complete stillness.\n\nI was on my back, staring up at nothing. No, not nothing. Stars. I was staring at stars. My hands were on asphalt, cold and rough. I sat up slowly, carefully, like any sudden movement might shatter whatever fragile reality had formed around me.\n\nI was in the parking lot.\n\nNot near it. In it. Lying next to Luke's Camaro. The driver's side door hung open. The dome light was on, casting everything in sickly yellow.\n\nI stood. My legs shook but held. I turned slowly, taking it in. The parking lot. The hospital in the distance. The forest pressing against the fence line.\n\nAnd Luke's car.\n\nI knew before I looked. Somehow I knew. But I looked anyway.\n\nLuke was in the driver's seat. Slumped over the steering wheel, his body bent at an angle that was only possible because there was nothing inside to stop it bending that way. His shirt had collapsed inward, empty, and even from outside the car I could see the void where his spine should have been.\n\nI made a sound. Not quite a scream. Not quite a sob. Something in between.\n\nI walked around to the passenger side on legs that didn't feel like mine. Opened the door with hands that had forgotten how to shake.\n\nCasey was there.\n\nFolded in on herself like origami. Her torso compressed, caved in, her body bent over her knees in a way that revealed the complete absence of ribs. Her ribcage was gone. Removed. Taken as payment.\n\nHer head rested on the dashboard, eyes open but not seeing. Not anymore.\n\nI closed the door carefully. Gently. Like she might wake up if I made too much noise.\n\nRyan's bike was still there. Still propped against the light pole where he'd left it.\n\nRyan was next to it.\n\nI couldn't look at him. Not directly. My eyes skated away from what was left of his face, from the collapsed ruin of his skull. But I saw enough. I saw the bike visible through where his head used to be. Saw the way his body looked boneless, deflated.\n\nI sat down in the parking lot. Right there on the cold asphalt. And I laughed. Not because anything was funny. Just because something had to come out and laughter was what my body chose. It turned into crying pretty quickly. Then back to laughing. Then I couldn't tell which one I was doing anymore.\n\nEventually, I called 911.\n\nTold them there'd been an accident at County Memorial. They asked what kind of accident and I said, \"You need to come. Please just come.\"\n\nThe cops arrived first. Then the ambulances. Then more cops. They separated me from the bodies, wrapped me in a foil blanket, asked questions I couldn't answer. What happened? Where were you? What did you see?\n\nI told them the truth. All of it. The creature. The wishes. The hospital.\n\nThey wrote it down with the kind of careful attention people give the clearly insane.\n\nBy morning, I was in the back of a police car. By afternoon, I was in a psychiatric ward.\n\nThey were kind. That's what made it worse. Everyone so gentle, so understanding. Asking me about what I'd experienced, nodding when I talked about the creature, taking careful notes. The medications came in little cups, pills that made everything feel distant and manageable.\n\n\"It was a psychotic break,\" the doctor told me after the first week. \"Trauma manifesting as hallucination. You survived something terrible and your mind created a narrative to cope.\"\n\nI learned to agree with him. Learned to say the right things, to show the right amount of progress. Three months of good behavior, of taking the pills, of going to group therapy and pretending I believed what they believed.\n\nThen they approved an outing. A supervised trip back into the world.\n\n\"We think you're ready,\" the doctor said. \"Ready to reintegrate.\"\n\nI know where I'm going.\n\nI know what I'll do.\n\nThe creature said we all had to wish. Ryan did. Luke did. Casey did. But I never made mine. The creature is still waiting. It has to be. Those are the rules.\n\nI'll go back to those woods. I'll find it in the darkness between the trees. And I'll say the words that have been circling in my head for three months, the only wish that makes sense now.\n\nMaybe it won't work. Maybe the creature is gone, maybe the rules don't function that way, maybe I'm just crazy after all and I'll wander those woods until I die of exposure.\n\nBut I have to try.\n\nBecause this, right here, breathing and walking and pretending to be alive while they're in the ground, this is the real horror. This is the real price.\n\nAnd tomorrow, I'm going to pay it.",

    "content": "Absolute wall of text ahead hahah.\n\nHey so a couple of days ago i've asked for recommendations on what to listen next after skimming through all the albums looking for very specific sounds. The consensus was that the best way to experience the Dan was listening the all the albums, in chronological order, from back to back. So i did just that, and i wanted to share my first impressions on these albums with you guys! Now mind that i'm a huge rock guy and i fuck with jazz too, but what i liked the most about SD was their more rock-ey sounding stuff, like Do It Again, Night By Night, etc. \n\n**CBAT**: The whole album is insane for a debut album. **Do It Again** was already my personal favorite that i probably played hundreds of times when i first discovered (as it was my introduction to SD!), but it being the first song, on the A side of their first album just elevates it even more for me. Absolutely insane.\n\n**Kings** was another one that caught me by surprise, i love the chord progression on this one and is one that is for sure going in my personal Dan playlist\n\n**Only a Fool Would Say That** didn't really catch my ear the first time i heard it a while ago, but for some reason i heard it again a couple of days ago and the bridge/chorus sound clicked so damn much to me that it quickly became one of my favorites from them! Great song, it being a jab at Lennon makes it even better.\n\nFrom CBAT that is mostly it, i had already listened to the whole thing before so no big surprises here, from now on the only other songs i really knew were Night by Night, Monkey on Your Soul and Hey Nineteen, so most of the albums was a first experience.\n\n\\-\n\n  \nOn **Countdown To Ecstasy** nothing really caught my ear until **My Old School**, where the guitar solos made me go \"What the actual fuck this is crazy\".\n\nThe ending to **King Of The World** is completely insane too and i was grooving HARD to it, insane solo and the synth goes hard too, almost reminds me of some more modern fusion jazz, stuff like Thundercat. Those were the stand outs for me from CTE, its a very solid album with some Jazzy almost Bossa Nova sounds (is it almost or IS it bossa nova? I think i should know it being brazilian but i have no idea, correct me if i'm wrong hahah).\n\n\\-\n\n  \nFrom **Pretzel Logic** i was already familiar with **Night By Night**, its a song that is up there for me in my ranking. I have a CD that i've burned with some \"cool driving songs\" and i've lost the count of how many times i've replayed this one, it has a VERY 70s cop/detective show theme song vibe that i like a LOT, and the solo is just wonderful.\n\n**Barrytown** caught me completely by surprise and it was a VERY fun song despite the theme of the lyrics. It was not the kind of stuff i was looking to put it in my playlist but theres something about the verses progression that scratches my brain just right and it makes me happy everything i hear it, i just love the way Fagen sings it. Fuck everyone from Barrytown btw.\n\nTwo little unexpected bits were **East St. Louis Toodle-Oo** and **With a Gun**. St. Louis was just very whimsy and fun, and i liked the unexpected western vibe of With a Gun. \n\n**Monkey In Your Soul** was another one that was already on my playlist, i just love how its sung and that fuzzy bass is just perfection. Sounds almost like Rolling Stones, and the lyrics are almost absurdist with \"fearing the monkey in your soul\". The horns goes hard as fuck too. Great one. \n\nNow i feel the need to reinforce that despite me only mentioning a few songs from each album (until a certain record, i guess you guys can guess which one), there were no bad songs at all. Despite me looking for some very specific vibes and sounds, no song was a skip for me. The craftsmanship and composition on each and every piece is just insane, Fagen and Becker were masters at what they were doing.\n\n  \n\\-\n\n  \n**Katy Lied** was the first and only album that no song really caught my attention, except for **Everyone's Gone to The Movies**, what the fuck was that LOL. It was still a VERY solid record, a lot of people mentioned on the original post about how you can really hear the progression and refinement of their sound and it is SO true. The difference from CBAT to KL is very noticeable. A very solid album, but not for me honestly.\n\n  \n\\-\n\n  \nOkay, the big one, where to start with **The Royal Scam**? This was BY FAR the most hyped album by you guys and honestly? I fucking get EVERY bit of it. Just bangers from start to finish, there were maybe one or two songs that i didn't really vibe to, but an extremely good album.\n\nSo my first contact was with **The Royal Scam**, the song, as someone had recommended just \"the royal scam\" and i was listening to it before deciding to start from the beginning. I didn't get to finish it but it liked it a LOT from the small part i heard, so we will save that for last.\n\n**The Caves of Altamira** sounded very familiar for some reason, what an extremely solid track with some great instruments and progression. Its honestly incredible how polished and well mixed this album is, you can follow EVERY instrument and it each and every one of them sounds wonderful. The sax on this is heavenly.\n\n**Don't Take me Alive** was one of the bigger highlights of the album for me, EASILY. That guitar at the begging is just fucking ridiculous, its a great example of EXACTLY what i was looking to find when i began this journey, some cool fucking songs to feel badass to listen to when driving with your arm out of the window. Love the guitar, love the chorus progression, love the bass. Holy shit i haven't talked about the bass in this band enough. EVERY SONG has amazing basslines, but one of the standouts came a little late, i'll get to that. This one has easily became one of my favorites;\n\n**The Fez** is an insanely groovy track, love the instrumental on this one, the synth and the organ goes insanely hard. It's also about safe sex! Hell yeah!\n\n**Green Earrings** was another track that really got me doing the \"oooooooh yeah this rocks\" face when listening to for the first time. VERY bouncy and groovy, again that bass fucking rules so much. Very 70s detective vibes from this one too.\n\nNow **The Royal Scam**. This one just feels GRAND you know? It sounds exactly like the album cover art, it sounds brutal and mean, and the lyrical theme reinforces that even more. I liked every single part of this song, the guitar tone, the almost ghostly organs, the drums (holy shit the drums), the back vocals, the horns. Arguably one of the greatest songs from them.\n\nI do get what they say now about this being probably one of their best work. Just non stop, EXTREMELY well composed and well polished pieces. A joy to listen to from start to finish, a true no skip album for me honestly.\n\n\\-\n\nNow let me finish by saying that i didn't get to Gaucho and Aja yet, i think those will become more my thing later, but as of right now nothing i've heard really caught my attention. There were some exceptions tho!\n\n**Hey Nineteen** was a personal favorite of mine, i just love how groovy and smooth it is, and how much of a loser the main character of the song is lmao. The first half of it is absolutely heaven for me with, i personally love the \"where the hell am i\" and the second chorus's \"No we got nothing in common (we cant talk at all). GREAT song.\n\nAnd last but not least, holy shit **Jack of Speed** from **Two Against Nature** caught me completely by surprise! It's another one of those songs that was EXACTLY what i was looking for, very groovy, smooth, cool guy shit. The bass progression is amazing, i also love the chorus. One thing that i did love even more was the **Live 1996 Version**, sang by Becker. Holy fuck that goes INSANELY hard, and i think i like it even more than the album version. I find it almost Hendrix like, with how the guitar is played, there are some almost orgasmic muted strums at the beginning. Becker also sounds amazing on the vocals, and from what i've heard that song was very personal to him, so DAMN he rocked that so much.\n\n\\-\n\nSo if you reached this far, thanks for reading! It was very very fun to immerse myself in the Dan for these last couple of days, and i can't thank enough everyone that took some time to recommend something in the last post, i read all the comments!

    "content": "Every day for 30 days I’m watching a different scary movie, this year all about alien invasions.  \n  \nThere’s a moviemaking term called “squeezing the lemon,” which means doing everything you can to maximize the potential of your movie’s concept. \n\nAt the risk of sounding like a deeply old man, if I have one big complaint about a lot of Hollywood movies today, it’s that they don’t squeeze the lemon hard enough.\n\nOn the other hand, “Killer Klowns From Outer Space” ANNIHILATES the lemon; there’s not a seed or fiber left when the credits roll. Whatever you think of the idea of a horror/comedy about sadistic outer space clowns invading Maycomb County, it is hard to argue anyone could have done more with it than we get here.\n\nWritten, directed, and produced by trio of effects whizzes the Chiodo Brothers, “Killer Klowns” rips off “The Blob” beat for beat, complete with the Lover’s Lane meteor sighting and skeptical cops blowing off the warnings of ne’er-do-well kids.\n\nExcept of course, it’s not the blob this time, it’s, well, clowns. Filmed in the South Bay, the movie stretches its tiny budget to fantastical lengths to generate credible atmosphere and punk rock sensibility. \n\nOn paper I should hate “Killer Klowns,” since I find clown imagery in horror generally hacky, and also, with some notable exceptions, I’m not a big fan of horror-comedies; it’s good for a horror movie to have a sense of humor, but generally I think displays of this kind of violence should at least try to take themselves seriously.\n\nBut I’m only human, and there’s something so immaculate and all-encompassing about “Killer Klowns From Outer Space” that it verges on a spiritual experience–like every B-movie of the past was somehow paving the way for the New Testament of this perfect garbage.\n\nThe casting is hit-or-miss: I love the sadistic middle-aged cop played by “Animal House” dean John Vernon, and the Good Cop played by John Nelson comes off as a pretty credible action lead considering how heavy of a lift he’s handed here. The various “teenage” actors are just kind of there though, and I find the comic relief brothers incredibly annoying.\n\nThat’s okay though, since the knockout makeup effects and ingeniously stupid “clown” gags are the real stars. This movie was a surprise box office hit and achieved immortality in the post-theatrical Valhalla of 90s cable TV. \n\nVarious attempts to resurrect it through sequels, remakes, and streaming series have failed, but maybe that’s just as well, because surely they pretty much nailed it the first time?\n\n“Killer Klowns” of course is the proverbial example of getting a laugh out of your horror premise on purpose, but what about those films that WEREN’T trying to be funny and landed there anyway?  \n  \nMore on that tomorrow.  \n  \nOriginal Trailer:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVQ3AGzeB\\_0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVQ3AGzeB_0)",

    "content": "The thing about Ryan was that he never committed to anything scary. Horror movies were out. Roller coasters were out. Even choosing colleges stressed him out because it meant closing doors, making something real and final. His therapist called it 'decision paralysis.' I called it self-preservation. When your dad walks out and your mom stops getting out of bed, you learn that some questions are better left unasked.\n\nI understood that. Ryan's mom had the kind of depression that kept the curtains drawn for weeks at a time. His dad left when Ryan was eleven, and the last thing the guy said before walking out was that Ryan needed to \"man up and help your mother.\" So Ryan learned to be quiet. To fade into the background of rooms. To make himself small enough that his presence wouldn't be another burden for anyone to carry.\n\nCasey was the opposite. She took up space like she'd been told her whole life she deserved to. Student council, debate team, Instagram aesthetic so carefully curated it looked effortless. Her parents were the kind of people who showed up to every event with professional cameras, who had her entire academic future mapped out on a literal poster board in their home office. Yale, then law school, then partnership in her father's firm.\n\nThe thing was, Casey actually wanted none of that. She'd told me once, sophomore year, that she wished she could just work in a plant nursery. Spend her days with her hands in dirt, helping things grow. But she'd said it like it was a joke, like the idea of disappointing her parents was so unthinkable it could only exist as fantasy.\n\nAnd Luke. Luke was more complicated than I wanted him to be.\n\nHe was tall, yeah. Played varsity football. Had the kind of easy confidence that came from never being told he couldn't do something. But here's the thing nobody else seemed to notice: Luke's dad hit him. Not often enough to leave marks that lasted, but enough. I'd seen Luke flinch once when Ryan clapped him on the shoulder too suddenly. Seen the way he stood sometimes, favoring his left side like his ribs were sore. He never talked about it, and I never asked, but it was there between us like smoke.\n\nThat's why he cheated on Casey, probably. Self-sabotage as a kind of protection. If you ruin it first, nobody can take it from you. I understood the logic even if I hated what it did to her. Even if watching her take him back felt like watching someone walk into traffic.\n\nMe? I was just trying to get through high school without my own damage becoming everyone else's problem.\n\nThe folklore started on a Reddit thread. Someone's uncle's coworker knew a guy who'd gone into the woods behind County Memorial and come back wrong. Different. Kept talking about prices and payments and how everything cost something. Three weeks later, he drove his truck into the lake with his whole family inside.\n\n\"It's bullshit,\" Ryan had said when Casey first brought it up, but his fingers were already drumming that nervous pattern on his knee. The one that meant he was thinking about it too hard, letting it get under his skin.\n\n\"Probably,\" Casey said. She was scrolling through satellite images of the hospital on her phone, zooming in on the forest that pressed against its southern edge. \"But wouldn't it be cool to check out? Just the hospital, I mean. Urban exploration.\"\n\nThe hospital had been abandoned since 2003. County Memorial, built in the forties, shut down after some Medicare fraud thing bankrupted the board. Six stories of brick and broken windows, wrapped in chain-link and covered in the kind of graffiti that suggested people came here specifically to be forgotten. The forest beyond it was old growth pine, dense enough that hikers got lost every few years. Search parties, helicopters, the whole production. Sometimes they found the bodies.\n\nWe were standing by Casey's locker between third and fourth period when she pitched the idea. Ryan looked like he wanted to crawl into the ventilation system. I was trying to figure out how to say no without sounding as scared as I felt when Luke appeared.\n\nHe had this way of moving through crowds like they were designed to part for him. People just stepped aside. He came up behind Casey and wrapped his arms around her waist, lifting her off her feet. She shrieked, kicking her legs, laughing in that way that made my stomach hurt.\n\n\"What are we talking about?\" Luke asked, setting her down.\n\nCasey turned in his arms, already grinning. \"The hospital. The one with the woods out back. We're thinking of exploring it.\"\n\n\"Sounds boring,\" Luke said, but he was looking at me when he said it, one eyebrow raised. \"Unless you're afraid.\"\n\nThere it was. The hook. Luke knew exactly what he was doing. He'd been doing it since middle school, this casual needling that made saying no feel like admitting weakness. It was manipulative and obvious and it worked anyway because I was seventeen and stupid.\n\n\"Tonight,\" I said. \"Seven o'clock.\"\n\nLuke smiled. Ryan looked like he might throw up.\n\nI told my parents I was sleeping at Ryan's. They barely looked up from their respective screens. My dad worked in insurance, my mom taught elementary school, and both of them seemed relieved I had friends to occupy my time. Teenagers were a mystery they'd decided not to solve.\n\nI climbed out my bedroom window at six thirty, dropping into the backyard with an impact that made my ankles ache. My bike was old, inherited from a cousin, and the chain made a clicking sound that seemed too loud in the quiet suburban evening. I texted Ryan that I was heading out. He sent back a thumbs up and nothing else.\n\nThe hospital was four miles away, past the nice part of town and into the part where houses had bars on the windows. The sun was setting, turning the sky the color of a bruise. By the time I reached the parking lot, full dark had fallen.\n\nThe place looked worse than the photos suggested. The fog was real, thick enough that it pooled in low spots like something liquid. The hospital loomed beyond it, all those shattered windows like eye sockets in a skull. Someone had painted \"MEMENTO MORI\" across the main entrance in dripping red letters.\n\nMy breath came out in clouds. October in New England, the kind of cold that got into your bones and stayed there. I tried Ryan's phone. It went straight to voicemail. Casey's rang four times and went to her cheerful recording.\n\nI took a photo. Posted it to Instagram with the caption \"bad decisions loading...\" and watched it get three likes before I'd even pocketed my phone.\n\nHeadlights swept across the lot. Luke's Camaro, black and impractical, his dad's castoff. The engine ticked as it cooled. Luke climbed out first, Casey from the passenger side. She was wearing his letterman jacket over her hoodie, drowning in it.\n\n\"Jesus,\" Luke said, breath fogging. \"It's freezing. Remind me why we're doing this?\"\n\n\"Adventure,\" Casey said, but she'd lost some of that enthusiasm from earlier. She looked small in the empty parking lot, younger than usual.\n\n\"Ryan's not here yet,\" I said.\n\nLuke snorted. \"Probably chickened out.\"\n\nThen we heard the bike. Ryan came pedaling into the lot like he was being chased, skidding to a stop next to mine. His helmet was crooked, his face flushed red from cold and exertion.\n\n\"Where the hell were you?\" I asked. \"I called.\"\n\n\"Got lost,\" Ryan panted. \"No signal out here. Everything looks the same in the dark.\"\n\nCasey was staring at the hospital now, really looking at it. \"Maybe this is stupid,\" she said quietly. \"Maybe we should just go home.\"\n\n\"We drove all the way out here,\" Luke said. He was already walking toward the building, hands shoved in his jacket pockets. \"Come on.\"\n\nWe followed the fence line around to the back. Up close, the hospital felt worse. Bigger. More present. Like it was aware of us in some fundamental way. The windows on the ground floor were boarded over, but higher up they gaped open, and I kept expecting to see movement in them. A face. A hand.\n\nRyan was breathing too fast, that panicky rhythm that meant he was spiraling. I'd seen it before, usually during tests or when his mom called during school.\n\nThe forest pressed against the fence, trees so dense they looked solid. Pine and oak and something that made the air smell like decay. We found a spot where someone had cut the chain link and peeled it back like the lid on a can.\n\n\"So we're really doing this?\" Casey asked. Nobody answered.\n\nLuke went first, ducking through. Then Casey. Then me and Ryan, who looked like he was walking to his execution.\n\nThe forest was colder. That shouldn't have been possible, but it was. Our phone lights made narrow tunnels in the dark, catching on bark and exposed roots and something that might have been animal bones. We walked single file, nobody speaking. There was no path. Just trees and darkness and the sound of our breathing.\n\nFive minutes in, Luke stopped.\n\n\"This is stupid,\" he said. \"There's nothing here. Let's go back, check out the hospital instead.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Casey said quickly. \"The hospital. Better idea.\"\n\nWe turned around. That's when something moved in the trees behind us.\n\nHeavy. Deliberate. The sound of something large displacing air. Casey backed into Luke, grabbing his arm. Ryan had gone statue-still, and when I looked at him, his face had lost all color.\n\n\"Animal,\" Luke said, but his voice was wrong. Too high.\n\nThe thing moved again. Closer. And with it came a sound like wind chimes made of bone, a clicking rattle that made my teeth ache.\n\nIt stepped into the light.\n\nI want to tell you I processed what I was seeing. That my brain took in the details and categorized them in any useful way. But that's not what happened. What happened was my mind just stopped, like a computer program hitting a fatal error.\n\nSeven feet tall, maybe more. A shape that suggested a body but refused to confirm one. Draped in moss and forest rot, organic material that might have been fabric or flesh or something in between. And the head. God. A deer skull, bleached white, antlers spreading like broken fingers. Around its neck, strung on what looked like sinew, hung dozens of teeth. Human teeth, maybe. Or animal. The distinction seemed less important than the fact of their existence.\n\nIt had no eyes but I felt it looking at us. Looking into us.\n\nLuke made a sound I'd never heard him make before, something between a sob and a laugh.\n\nThe thing's jaw opened. Not like a jaw should, but hinging wrong, too wide, and when it spoke, the voice came from everywhere and nowhere. From inside my skull and from the ground and from the air itself.\n\n\"You come to wish.\"\n\nThe words scraped like rusted metal dragging across bone.\n\n\"All of you must wish.\"\n\nCasey was crying. I could hear it, small hitching sobs behind me, but I couldn't turn to look at her. Couldn't stop staring at the creature, at the way it seemed to shift and settle like it wasn't quite solid, wasn't quite real.\n\nThe skull twitched toward Ryan.\n\nRyan opened his mouth. Closed it. His hands were shaking so badly I could see it even in the bad light.\n\n\"Wish,\" the creature said, and its voice got louder, resonant, shaking the trees. \"WISH NOW.\"\n\n\"I wish,\" Ryan started, then stopped. His voice was barely a whisper. \"I wish to know if God is real.\"\n\nI don't know what I expected. Maybe nothing. Maybe for the thing to laugh or vanish or tell us we were all idiots playing with urban legends. But that's not what happened.\n\nThe creature convulsed. Its body, that shapeless mass, began twitching violently, and the deer skull lurched sideways at an angle that made my stomach turn. The bone necklace rattled in the opposite direction, spinning, and the sound it made was like grinding vertebrae.\n\nRyan screamed.\n\nNot a shout or a yell. A scream. The kind that carries agony and terror in equal measure, that sounds like someone being unmade at the molecular level. His hands shot to his head, fingers clawing at his skull, and then I saw it happen.\n\nHis head was collapsing inward.\n\nThe bones of his skull were folding like paper, caving in on themselves, and his face, Ryan's face, the one I'd known since we were twelve, was disappearing into the void it left behind. The skin went slack and then concave, and the scream cut off into something wet and horrible and then into nothing at all.\n\nHe hit the ground.\n\nCasey's scream replaced his, raw and primal. Luke grabbed her arm hard enough to bruise.\n\n\"Run,\" he said.\n\nWe ran.\n\nI crashed through a low hanging branch that whipped across my face, bark scraping my cheek raw. My phone was in my hand, light jerking wildly, turning the forest into a strobe nightmare of trees and shadows and nothing that made sense. Behind us, I could hear it. That rattling. Bone on bone, getting closer.\n\nCasey was sobbing as she ran, these gasping, hitching breaths between footfalls. Luke was ahead of her, pulling her by the wrist, and I was behind them both, and I couldn't stop thinking about Ryan. About the way his face had just collapsed, folded in on itself like wet cardboard.\n\nMy foot caught on a root and I went down hard, phone flying from my hand. The impact knocked the air from my lungs. I scrabbled in the dirt, fingers finding leaves and moss and something that felt horribly like bone before my hand closed around the phone.\n\nThe light was facing back the way we'd come.\n\nThe creature was there.\n\nNot far. Maybe twenty feet. Moving through the trees with that horrible fluid motion, branches bending around it like they were afraid to touch it. The deer skull was angled toward me, antlers scraping bark, and the bone necklace swayed and clattered with each movement.\n\nI could see details now that I hadn't before. The way the moss covering its body seemed to grow and shift, pulsing like something alive. The teeth on the necklace weren't all the same size. Some were small, child-sized. Others were long and pointed, predator teeth. And there were other things strung between them. Small bones. Finger bones maybe. And something that looked horrifyingly like a dried human ear.\n\n\"GET UP!\" Luke's voice, somewhere ahead in the darkness.\n\nI rolled onto my hands and knees, pushed myself up. My ankle screamed in protest but held. I ran.\n\nThe forest had become a maze. Every tree looked the same. Every shadow held something terrible. My lungs burned. The cold air felt like breathing broken glass. I could hear Luke and Casey ahead, crashing through undergrowth, and I pushed harder, trying to catch up.\n\nBehind me, that rattling never stopped. It stayed constant, rhythmic, like the creature was pacing itself. Like it knew it didn't need to rush. Like this was all part of something it had done a thousand times before.\n\nMy phone light caught Casey's jacket ahead, that bright red. I focused on it, used it as a beacon. We were running uphill now, the ground getting steeper, roots reaching across the path like fingers trying to trip us. My thighs burned. My ankle throbbed with each impact.\n\nThen Casey went down.\n\nShe cried out, a sharp yelp of pain, and Luke skidded to a stop. I nearly crashed into him. Casey was on the ground, clutching her leg, her phone a few feet away casting crazy shadows across her face.\n\n\"I can't,\" she gasped. \"My ankle, I can't.\"\n\nLuke looked back. Even in the bad light, I could see his face. The calculation happening there. The math of who lives and who dies.\n\n\"Help me get her up,\" I said, moving to Casey's other side.\n\nWe each took an arm, hauled her to her feet. She whimpered, tried to put weight on her right leg and nearly collapsed again. Luke and I locked our arms behind her back, made a kind of chair. She looped her arms around our necks.\n\nWe moved slower now. So much slower. Casey's weight between us, her breathing ragged in my ear. The creature's rattling got louder. Closer. I could feel its presence like a pressure change, like the air itself was being displaced by something too large, too wrong.\n\n\"There,\" Luke panted. \"I see the fence.\"\n\nAnd there it was, chain-link glinting in our phone lights, and beyond it, the dark mass of the hospital. We were coming at it from an angle, not the way we'd entered. This section of fence was intact but there was a spot maybe ten yards down where it had been peeled back.\n\nWe staggered toward it, Casey's weight making every step feel like we were wading through concrete. Five yards. Three.\n\nBehind us, branches cracked. Not the small pops of twigs breaking. The deep groan of something large pushing through resistance. I risked a look back.\n\nThe creature had closed the distance. It was right there, maybe fifteen feet away, and in the better light near the fence line I could see it clearly for the first time.\n\nIt wasn't wearing the moss and rot. That was its skin. Bark and organic material fused together into something that might have once been alive but had evolved past that into something else. The deer skull was partially embedded in its body, grown into it, and where the skull ended and the body began was impossible to determine. The antlers weren't antlers at all. They were bones. Human bones. Femurs and radius and ulna, all twisted and fused together into that branching structure.\n\nAnd the worst part, the part that made my bladder almost let go, was that the skull was moving. Not the creature's head, but the skull itself. The jaw was opening and closing in a rhythm that matched the rattling of the bone necklace, and I could see something behind the bone. Something dark and writhing, like the inside of the skull was full of worms or maggots or things that squirmed.\n\n\"Go, go, GO!\" I screamed.\n\nWe hit the fence line. Luke dropped Casey's arm, grabbed the peeled-back section and hauled it up. The metal shrieked. Casey went under first, on her hands and knees, crawling. I was right behind her, and behind me I could hear the creature moving faster now, could hear that rattling building to a crescendo.\n\nI was halfway under when I felt something grab my jacket. Not a hand. Nothing as simple as a hand. Something that felt like it had too many points of contact, like it was gripping me in six places at once. The fabric pulled taut, yanking me backward, and I screamed.\n\nCasey was on the other side, reaching back through, grabbing my arms. Luke was there too, pulling. I was caught between them, the fence cutting into my back, the creature's grip tightening. I could smell it now. Rot and earth and something sweet underneath, like decomposition, like meat going bad in the sun.\n\nMy jacket tore.\n\nThe sound was loud, that ripping canvas noise, and suddenly I was sliding forward, under the fence, Luke and Casey falling backward with me on top. We landed in a heap on the asphalt. I rolled, looked back.\n\nThe creature was pressed against the fence. Not trying to climb it or break through. Just standing there, that deer skull tilted, watching us. The bone necklace had gone still. In the parking lot lights, I could see my jacket, or what was left of it, hanging from one of the fence posts. It was shredded. Not cut. Shredded, like something with claws had grabbed it.\n\nBut the creature had no hands.\n\n\"Come on,\" Luke said, already pulling Casey to her feet. \"The hospital. We get inside, we're safe.\"\n\nI didn't know what made him think that. Didn't know what made him think we'd be safe anywhere. But the alternative was standing here in the parking lot while that thing watched us, so I got up and ran.\n\nThe hospital entrance gaped open. Someone had torn the boards off years ago. Inside was darkness, deeper than the forest, and that smell. Mold and decay and stale air that hadn't moved in decades. Our phones lit the way, catching on debris. A wheelchair, rusted, one wheel missing. Medical charts scattered across the floor, patient names still visible. An IV stand lying on its side.\n\nWe moved into the lobby, a wide open space with a reception desk that had been stripped of anything valuable. The floor was tile, broken in places, and our footsteps echoed wrong. Too loud. Like the building was paying attention.\n\n\"We can't stay here,\" Casey said. She was limping badly, putting almost no weight on her right leg. \"It'll come in. It'll find us.\"\n\n\"Then we go up,\" Luke said, gesturing to a stairwell on the far side of the lobby. \"Get to the second floor, find a room we can barricade.\"\n\n\"Or we go straight through,\" I said, pointing to a hallway that led deeper into the building. \"Find the other side, get back to the parking lot. Get to the car.\"\n\nLuke looked at Casey, then at me. I saw the decision forming. Saw the exact moment he chose.\n\n\"Through is faster,\" he said, already moving toward the hallway.\n\nWe followed. Casey between us again, hobbling, trying to keep up. The hallway was narrower than the lobby, doors lining both sides. Most were closed. Some hung open, revealing rooms full of stripped beds and broken equipment. Our phone lights made everything worse, turning shadows into threats, making every corner a potential ambush.\n\nWe passed a nurse's station. The desk was overturned, papers everywhere, and something had made a nest in the corner. I couldn't tell what. Blankets and trash and something else, something organic that I didn't want to look at too closely.\n\nThen we heard it behind us.\n\nThat rattling.\n\nInside the building now. In the lobby. The sound echoed off the walls, distorted, making it impossible to tell exactly where it was coming from. But it was close. Getting closer.\n\n\"Faster,\" Luke hissed.\n\nCasey was crying again, quiet sobs that she was trying to muffle. We were moving as fast as we could, but her ankle was bad, really bad, and each step was agony for her. I could feel it in the way she gripped my shoulder, nails digging in through my shirt.\n\nThe hallway branched. Luke took the left corridor without hesitating. We followed. This hallway was darker somehow, fewer windows, and the air felt thicker. Harder to breathe. Like the building's decay had concentrated here.\n\nBehind us, the rattling got louder. I risked a look back and saw nothing but darkness and the pathetic throw of our phone lights. But I could feel it. That presence. That wrongness.\n\n\"There,\" Luke said, pointing ahead.\n\nA door. Different from the others. Metal instead of wood, with a small window set at eye level. Emergency exit, maybe. A way out. We stumbled toward it, Casey whimpering with each step, and Luke hit it at full speed.\n\nIt didn't budge.\n\nHe slammed into it, bounced back, tried the handle. Locked. He threw his shoulder against it again, and again, and the door rattled in its frame but held.\n\n\"Fuck,\" he said. \"Fuck, fuck, FUCK.\"\n\nThe rattling was louder now. So loud it seemed to come from the walls themselves. I turned, putting myself between Casey and the direction we'd come, and my phone light caught movement at the end of the hallway.\n\nThe creature was there.\n\nIt had to hunch to fit in the corridor, that deer skull scraping the ceiling tiles. Bits of acoustic foam rained down as it moved, and the sound of its passage was wrong. Wet and grinding, like meat being forced through a space too small.\n\n\"Luke,\" I said, and my voice was surprisingly steady. \"We need to move.\"\n\n\"The door's locked!\"\n\n\"Then we find another door!\"\n\nLuke grabbed Casey's arm and pulled her away from the exit. We ran back the way we'd come, but the creature was blocking that path now, so we took the first door we came to. It opened into a patient room, and we slammed it shut behind us.\n\nThe room was small. A single bed, stripped to the frame. A window with bars on it, glass long gone, letting in cold air and the smell of the forest. A small bathroom in the corner, door hanging off one hinge.\n\n\"We're trapped,\" Casey said. She'd given up trying to stop crying. Tears tracked down her face, catching in our phone lights. \"We're trapped and it's going to kill us.\"\n\n\"There has to be another way out,\" I said, moving to the window. The bars were solid, old but not rusted enough to break. I shook them anyway. They didn't move.\n\nBehind us, in the hallway, the rattling had stopped.\n\nThe silence was worse. So much worse. Because silence meant it was listening. Hunting. Planning.\n\nLuke was at the door, ear pressed against it, trying to hear movement. His hand was on the handle, knuckles white.\n\n\"I don't hear anything,\" he whispered.\n\n\"That doesn't mean it's not there,\" Casey said.\n\nWe waited. Seconds that felt like hours. My heart was beating so hard I could feel it in my throat, in my temples. The cold air from the window made me shiver, or maybe that was just fear. Probably fear.\n\nThen something scraped against the door.\n\nNot a knock. A long, drawn-out scrape, like bone on metal. The door shuddered. Luke jumped back, nearly dropping his phone.\n\nThe scraping came again, lower this time. Then higher. Like the thing was testing the door, learning its dimensions.\n\nThe handle started to turn.\n\nLuke grabbed it, tried to hold it, but the force on the other side was immense. The handle turned despite his grip, despite him throwing his weight against it, and the door began to open.\n\n\"Help me!\" Luke screamed.\n\nI ran to the door, added my weight. Casey was there too, her bad ankle forgotten, all of us pressing against the door as it slowly, inexorably, opened. It was like trying to hold back a freight train. Like trying to stop gravity.\n\nThe door opened six inches. Then a foot. Through the gap, I could see the hallway, and I could see the creature.\n\nIt had changed. Or maybe I was just seeing it more clearly. The deer skull was at ground level now, and I realized the creature didn't have a fixed orientation. It could move in any direction, could reorient itself however it needed. The skull was sideways now, antlers scraping the doorframe, and behind it, that body of moss and rot and wrong, and in the darkness behind the skull's eye sockets, I saw movement. Saw things writhing.\n\nThe door opened another foot.\n\n\"The bathroom!\" Casey screamed. \"Go, go!\"\n\nWe broke, all of us at once, abandoning the door and sprinting for the bathroom. It was tiny, barely enough room for the three of us, but we crammed inside and Luke grabbed the door. This one was lighter, flimsier, but it had a lock. He turned it just as the patient room door slammed open behind us.\n\nThe creature filled the doorway.\n\nThrough the crack at the bottom of the bathroom door, I could see it. Could see that mass of organic material spreading across the tile, and the shadow it cast was wrong. Too many angles. Too much depth.\n\nThen came the voice.\n\n\"Wish,\" it said, and the word rattled through the building. \"Must wish. All must wish.\"\n\nLuke's face was white. He was backed against the sink, hands gripping the porcelain like it was the only thing keeping him upright. Casey was in the corner, arms wrapped around herself, rocking slightly.\n\nThe door shuddered. Something hit it, heavy, and the wood cracked.\n\n\"Wish,\" the creature said again. \"You. Wish. NOW.\"\n\nThe door splintered. Wood shards exploded inward. A piece hit my arm, drawing blood. Through the hole in the door, I could see the deer skull, could see those empty sockets looking in at us.\n\nLuke's voice came out strangled, desperate.\n\n\"I wish you were dead,\" he said. \"I wish you were fucking dead.\"\n\nThe creature's response was immediate. The deer skull snapped back, and that rattling started again, frenzied, and Luke's hands flew to his back.\n\nHe screamed.\n\nNot like Ryan. Different. This was a scream of confusion more than pain, at least at first. Then the pain came. I watched his body arch backward, watched his shirt collapse inward like something was being pulled out from underneath, and I understood.\n\nThe creature was removing his spine.\n\nNot all at once. Bone by bone. Vertebra by vertebra. I could see them going, could see the shirt fabric cave where each bone disappeared. Luke's body bent backward, farther than any body should bend, and the scream went on and on until his lungs couldn't support it anymore and it became a wet gurgle.\n\nThen he fell.\n\nCasey was screaming. Had been screaming. I grabbed her, pulled her close, but she fought me. Pushed me away.\n\n\"No!\" she shouted at the creature. At the deer skull watching us through the broken door. \"I wish none of this ever happened! I wish we never came here!\"\n\nAnd the world broke.\n\nThat's the only way I can describe it. Reality fractured like glass, and through the cracks I could see something else. Other versions of this moment. Other timelines where we made different choices. Where we didn't come. Where we turned back. Where Ryan said something else. All of them existing simultaneously, overlapping, bleeding into each other.\n\nThe buzzing started in my skull, building and building until I thought my head would explode. The bathroom walls rippled like water. Casey was there and then not there and then there again, flickering like a broken film strip. The creature's rattling became a roar, became everything, became the only sound in existence.\n\nI fell.\n\nOr flew.\n\nOr both.\n\nTime inverted. Collapsed. Expanded. I saw Ryan's face caving in again but backward, saw it inflate like a balloon. Saw Luke's spine returning, then disappearing again. Saw Casey running, screaming, laughing, all at the same time.\n\nThen it stopped.\n\nComplete silence. Complete stillness.\n\nI was on my back, staring up at nothing. No, not nothing. Stars. I was staring at stars. My hands were on asphalt, cold and rough. I sat up slowly, carefully, like any sudden movement might shatter whatever fragile reality had formed around me.\n\nI was in the parking lot.\n\nNot near it. In it. Lying next to Luke's Camaro. The driver's side door hung open. The dome light was on, casting everything in sickly yellow.\n\nI stood. My legs shook but held. I turned slowly, taking it in. The parking lot. The hospital in the distance. The forest pressing against the fence line.\n\nAnd Luke's car.\n\nI knew before I looked. Somehow I knew. But I looked anyway.\n\nLuke was in the driver's seat. Slumped over the steering wheel, his body bent at an angle that was only possible because there was nothing inside to stop it bending that way. His shirt had collapsed inward, empty, and even from outside the car I could see the void where his spine should have been.\n\nI made a sound. Not quite a scream. Not quite a sob. Something in between.\n\nI walked around to the passenger side on legs that didn't feel like mine. Opened the door with hands that had forgotten how to shake.\n\nCasey was there.\n\nFolded in on herself like origami. Her torso compressed, caved in, her body bent over her knees in a way that revealed the complete absence of ribs. Her ribcage was gone. Removed. Taken as payment.\n\nHer head rested on the dashboard, eyes open but not seeing. Not anymore.\n\nI closed the door carefully. Gently. Like she might wake up if I made too much noise.\n\nRyan's bike was still there. Still propped against the light pole where he'd left it.\n\nRyan was next to it.\n\nI couldn't look at him. Not directly. My eyes skated away from what was left of his face, from the collapsed ruin of his skull. But I saw enough. I saw the bike visible through where his head used to be. Saw the way his body looked boneless, deflated.\n\nI sat down in the parking lot. Right there on the cold asphalt. And I laughed. Not because anything was funny. Just because something had to come out and laughter was what my body chose. It turned into crying pretty quickly. Then back to laughing. Then I couldn't tell which one I was doing anymore.\n\nEventually, I called 911.\n\nTold them there'd been an accident at County Memorial. They asked what kind of accident and I said, \"You need to come. Please just come.\"\n\nThe cops arrived first. Then the ambulances. Then more cops. They separated me from the bodies, wrapped me in a foil blanket, asked questions I couldn't answer. What happened? Where were you? What did you see?\n\nI told them the truth. All of it. The creature. The wishes. The hospital.\n\nThey wrote it down with the kind of careful attention people give the clearly insane.\n\nBy morning, I was in the back of a police car. By afternoon, I was in a psychiatric ward.\n\nThey were kind. That's what made it worse. Everyone so gentle, so understanding. Asking me about what I'd experienced, nodding when I talked about the creature, taking careful notes. The medications came in little cups, pills that made everything feel distant and manageable.\n\n\"It was a psychotic break,\" the doctor told me after the first week. \"Trauma manifesting as hallucination. You survived something terrible and your mind created a narrative to cope.\"\n\nI learned to agree with him. Learned to say the right things, to show the right amount of progress. Three months of good behavior, of taking the pills, of going to group therapy and pretending I believed what they believed.\n\nThen they approved an outing. A supervised trip back into the world.\n\n\"We think you're ready,\" the doctor said. \"Ready to reintegrate.\"\n\nI know where I'm going.\n\nI know what I'll do.\n\nThe creature said we all had to wish. Ryan did. Luke did. Casey did. But I never made mine. The creature is still waiting. It has to be. Those are the rules.\n\nI'll go back to those woods. I'll find it in the darkness between the trees. And I'll say the words that have been circling in my head for three months, the only wish that makes sense now.\n\nMaybe it won't work. Maybe the creature is gone, maybe the rules don't function that way, maybe I'm just crazy after all and I'll wander those woods until I die of exposure.\n\nBut I have to try.\n\nBecause this, right here, breathing and walking and pretending to be alive while they're in the ground, this is the real horror. This is the real price.\n\nAnd tomorrow, I'm going to pay it.",

One of the problems with the 3DS is that the original battery no longer holds a charge so it would need to be replaced. And due to the battery expanding, the bottom portion of the 3DS has split apart but still holds together and functions normally. I'm not sure if a few small screws ended up going missing and that's why it can split apart. Included with the system is the charging dock/adapter, circle pad pro, and Amiibo reader - all working. Not pictured are a set of Amiibo AR cards which I can include for a few extra dollars if needed.)\n\n**PSP 1001 Model - $35**\n\n(Missing battery and is untested. No Memory Stick Duo included.

    "content": "The thing about Ryan was that he never committed to anything scary. Horror movies were out. Roller coasters were out. Even choosing colleges stressed him out because it meant closing doors, making something real and final. His therapist called it 'decision paralysis.' I called it self-preservation. When your dad walks out and your mom stops getting out of bed, you learn that some questions are better left unasked.\n\nI understood that. Ryan's mom had the kind of depression that kept the curtains drawn for weeks at a time. His dad left when Ryan was eleven, and the last thing the guy said before walking out was that Ryan needed to \"man up and help your mother.\" So Ryan learned to be quiet. To fade into the background of rooms. To make himself small enough that his presence wouldn't be another burden for anyone to carry.\n\nCasey was the opposite. She took up space like she'd been told her whole life she deserved to. Student council, debate team, Instagram aesthetic so carefully curated it looked effortless. Her parents were the kind of people who showed up to every event with professional cameras, who had her entire academic future mapped out on a literal poster board in their home office. Yale, then law school, then partnership in her father's firm.\n\nThe thing was, Casey actually wanted none of that. She'd told me once, sophomore year, that she wished she could just work in a plant nursery. Spend her days with her hands in dirt, helping things grow. But she'd said it like it was a joke, like the idea of disappointing her parents was so unthinkable it could only exist as fantasy.\n\nAnd Luke. Luke was more complicated than I wanted him to be.\n\nHe was tall, yeah. Played varsity football. Had the kind of easy confidence that came from never being told he couldn't do something. But here's the thing nobody else seemed to notice: Luke's dad hit him. Not often enough to leave marks that lasted, but enough. I'd seen Luke flinch once when Ryan clapped him on the shoulder too suddenly. Seen the way he stood sometimes, favoring his left side like his ribs were sore. He never talked about it, and I never asked, but it was there between us like smoke.\n\nThat's why he cheated on Casey, probably. Self-sabotage as a kind of protection. If you ruin it first, nobody can take it from you. I understood the logic even if I hated what it did to her. Even if watching her take him back felt like watching someone walk into traffic.\n\nMe? I was just trying to get through high school without my own damage becoming everyone else's problem.\n\nThe folklore started on a Reddit thread. Someone's uncle's coworker knew a guy who'd gone into the woods behind County Memorial and come back wrong. Different. Kept talking about prices and payments and how everything cost something. Three weeks later, he drove his truck into the lake with his whole family inside.\n\n\"It's bullshit,\" Ryan had said when Casey first brought it up, but his fingers were already drumming that nervous pattern on his knee. The one that meant he was thinking about it too hard, letting it get under his skin.\n\n\"Probably,\" Casey said. She was scrolling through satellite images of the hospital on her phone, zooming in on the forest that pressed against its southern edge. \"But wouldn't it be cool to check out? Just the hospital, I mean. Urban exploration.\"\n\nThe hospital had been abandoned since 2003. County Memorial, built in the forties, shut down after some Medicare fraud thing bankrupted the board. Six stories of brick and broken windows, wrapped in chain-link and covered in the kind of graffiti that suggested people came here specifically to be forgotten. The forest beyond it was old growth pine, dense enough that hikers got lost every few years. Search parties, helicopters, the whole production. Sometimes they found the bodies.\n\nWe were standing by Casey's locker between third and fourth period when she pitched the idea. Ryan looked like he wanted to crawl into the ventilation system. I was trying to figure out how to say no without sounding as scared as I felt when Luke appeared.\n\nHe had this way of moving through crowds like they were designed to part for him. People just stepped aside. He came up behind Casey and wrapped his arms around her waist, lifting her off her feet. She shrieked, kicking her legs, laughing in that way that made my stomach hurt.\n\n\"What are we talking about?\" Luke asked, setting her down.\n\nCasey turned in his arms, already grinning. \"The hospital. The one with the woods out back. We're thinking of exploring it.\"\n\n\"Sounds boring,\" Luke said, but he was looking at me when he said it, one eyebrow raised. \"Unless you're afraid.\"\n\nThere it was. The hook. Luke knew exactly what he was doing. He'd been doing it since middle school, this casual needling that made saying no feel like admitting weakness. It was manipulative and obvious and it worked anyway because I was seventeen and stupid.\n\n\"Tonight,\" I said. \"Seven o'clock.\"\n\nLuke smiled. Ryan looked like he might throw up.\n\nI told my parents I was sleeping at Ryan's. They barely looked up from their respective screens. My dad worked in insurance, my mom taught elementary school, and both of them seemed relieved I had friends to occupy my time. Teenagers were a mystery they'd decided not to solve.\n\nI climbed out my bedroom window at six thirty, dropping into the backyard with an impact that made my ankles ache. My bike was old, inherited from a cousin, and the chain made a clicking sound that seemed too loud in the quiet suburban evening. I texted Ryan that I was heading out. He sent back a thumbs up and nothing else.\n\nThe hospital was four miles away, past the nice part of town and into the part where houses had bars on the windows. The sun was setting, turning the sky the color of a bruise. By the time I reached the parking lot, full dark had fallen.\n\nThe place looked worse than the photos suggested. The fog was real, thick enough that it pooled in low spots like something liquid. The hospital loomed beyond it, all those shattered windows like eye sockets in a skull. Someone had painted \"MEMENTO MORI\" across the main entrance in dripping red letters.\n\nMy breath came out in clouds. October in New England, the kind of cold that got into your bones and stayed there. I tried Ryan's phone. It went straight to voicemail. Casey's rang four times and went to her cheerful recording.\n\nI took a photo. Posted it to Instagram with the caption \"bad decisions loading...\" and watched it get three likes before I'd even pocketed my phone.\n\nHeadlights swept across the lot. Luke's Camaro, black and impractical, his dad's castoff. The engine ticked as it cooled. Luke climbed out first, Casey from the passenger side. She was wearing his letterman jacket over her hoodie, drowning in it.\n\n\"Jesus,\" Luke said, breath fogging. \"It's freezing. Remind me why we're doing this?\"\n\n\"Adventure,\" Casey said, but she'd lost some of that enthusiasm from earlier. She looked small in the empty parking lot, younger than usual.\n\n\"Ryan's not here yet,\" I said.\n\nLuke snorted. \"Probably chickened out.\"\n\nThen we heard the bike. Ryan came pedaling into the lot like he was being chased, skidding to a stop next to mine. His helmet was crooked, his face flushed red from cold and exertion.\n\n\"Where the hell were you?\" I asked. \"I called.\"\n\n\"Got lost,\" Ryan panted. \"No signal out here. Everything looks the same in the dark.\"\n\nCasey was staring at the hospital now, really looking at it. \"Maybe this is stupid,\" she said quietly. \"Maybe we should just go home.\"\n\n\"We drove all the way out here,\" Luke said. He was already walking toward the building, hands shoved in his jacket pockets. \"Come on.\"\n\nWe followed the fence line around to the back. Up close, the hospital felt worse. Bigger. More present. Like it was aware of us in some fundamental way. The windows on the ground floor were boarded over, but higher up they gaped open, and I kept expecting to see movement in them. A face. A hand.\n\nRyan was breathing too fast, that panicky rhythm that meant he was spiraling. I'd seen it before, usually during tests or when his mom called during school.\n\nThe forest pressed against the fence, trees so dense they looked solid. Pine and oak and something that made the air smell like decay. We found a spot where someone had cut the chain link and peeled it back like the lid on a can.\n\n\"So we're really doing this?\" Casey asked. Nobody answered.\n\nLuke went first, ducking through. Then Casey. Then me and Ryan, who looked like he was walking to his execution.\n\nThe forest was colder. That shouldn't have been possible, but it was. Our phone lights made narrow tunnels in the dark, catching on bark and exposed roots and something that might have been animal bones. We walked single file, nobody speaking. There was no path. Just trees and darkness and the sound of our breathing.\n\nFive minutes in, Luke stopped.\n\n\"This is stupid,\" he said. \"There's nothing here. Let's go back, check out the hospital instead.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Casey said quickly. \"The hospital. Better idea.\"\n\nWe turned around. That's when something moved in the trees behind us.\n\nHeavy. Deliberate. The sound of something large displacing air. Casey backed into Luke, grabbing his arm. Ryan had gone statue-still, and when I looked at him, his face had lost all color.\n\n\"Animal,\" Luke said, but his voice was wrong. Too high.\n\nThe thing moved again. Closer. And with it came a sound like wind chimes made of bone, a clicking rattle that made my teeth ache.\n\nIt stepped into the light.\n\nI want to tell you I processed what I was seeing. That my brain took in the details and categorized them in any useful way. But that's not what happened. What happened was my mind just stopped, like a computer program hitting a fatal error.\n\nSeven feet tall, maybe more. A shape that suggested a body but refused to confirm one. Draped in moss and forest rot, organic material that might have been fabric or flesh or something in between. And the head. God. A deer skull, bleached white, antlers spreading like broken fingers. Around its neck, strung on what looked like sinew, hung dozens of teeth. Human teeth, maybe. Or animal. The distinction seemed less important than the fact of their existence.\n\nIt had no eyes but I felt it looking at us. Looking into us.\n\nLuke made a sound I'd never heard him make before, something between a sob and a laugh.\n\nThe thing's jaw opened. Not like a jaw should, but hinging wrong, too wide, and when it spoke, the voice came from everywhere and nowhere. From inside my skull and from the ground and from the air itself.\n\n\"You come to wish.\"\n\nThe words scraped like rusted metal dragging across bone.\n\n\"All of you must wish.\"\n\nCasey was crying. I could hear it, small hitching sobs behind me, but I couldn't turn to look at her. Couldn't stop staring at the creature, at the way it seemed to shift and settle like it wasn't quite solid, wasn't quite real.\n\nThe skull twitched toward Ryan.\n\nRyan opened his mouth. Closed it. His hands were shaking so badly I could see it even in the bad light.\n\n\"Wish,\" the creature said, and its voice got louder, resonant, shaking the trees. \"WISH NOW.\"\n\n\"I wish,\" Ryan started, then stopped. His voice was barely a whisper. \"I wish to know if God is real.\"\n\nI don't know what I expected. Maybe nothing. Maybe for the thing to laugh or vanish or tell us we were all idiots playing with urban legends. But that's not what happened.\n\nThe creature convulsed. Its body, that shapeless mass, began twitching violently, and the deer skull lurched sideways at an angle that made my stomach turn. The bone necklace rattled in the opposite direction, spinning, and the sound it made was like grinding vertebrae.\n\nRyan screamed.\n\nNot a shout or a yell. A scream. The kind that carries agony and terror in equal measure, that sounds like someone being unmade at the molecular level. His hands shot to his head, fingers clawing at his skull, and then I saw it happen.\n\nHis head was collapsing inward.\n\nThe bones of his skull were folding like paper, caving in on themselves, and his face, Ryan's face, the one I'd known since we were twelve, was disappearing into the void it left behind. The skin went slack and then concave, and the scream cut off into something wet and horrible and then into nothing at all.\n\nHe hit the ground.\n\nCasey's scream replaced his, raw and primal. Luke grabbed her arm hard enough to bruise.\n\n\"Run,\" he said.\n\nWe ran.\n\nI crashed through a low hanging branch that whipped across my face, bark scraping my cheek raw. My phone was in my hand, light jerking wildly, turning the forest into a strobe nightmare of trees and shadows and nothing that made sense. Behind us, I could hear it. That rattling. Bone on bone, getting closer.\n\nCasey was sobbing as she ran, these gasping, hitching breaths between footfalls. Luke was ahead of her, pulling her by the wrist, and I was behind them both, and I couldn't stop thinking about Ryan. About the way his face had just collapsed, folded in on itself like wet cardboard.\n\nMy foot caught on a root and I went down hard, phone flying from my hand. The impact knocked the air from my lungs. I scrabbled in the dirt, fingers finding leaves and moss and something that felt horribly like bone before my hand closed around the phone.\n\nThe light was facing back the way we'd come.\n\nThe creature was there.\n\nNot far. Maybe twenty feet. Moving through the trees with that horrible fluid motion, branches bending around it like they were afraid to touch it. The deer skull was angled toward me, antlers scraping bark, and the bone necklace swayed and clattered with each movement.\n\nI could see details now that I hadn't before. The way the moss covering its body seemed to grow and shift, pulsing like something alive. The teeth on the necklace weren't all the same size. Some were small, child-sized. Others were long and pointed, predator teeth. And there were other things strung between them. Small bones. Finger bones maybe. And something that looked horrifyingly like a dried human ear.\n\n\"GET UP!\" Luke's voice, somewhere ahead in the darkness.\n\nI rolled onto my hands and knees, pushed myself up. My ankle screamed in protest but held. I ran.\n\nThe forest had become a maze. Every tree looked the same. Every shadow held something terrible. My lungs burned. The cold air felt like breathing broken glass. I could hear Luke and Casey ahead, crashing through undergrowth, and I pushed harder, trying to catch up.\n\nBehind me, that rattling never stopped. It stayed constant, rhythmic, like the creature was pacing itself. Like it knew it didn't need to rush. Like this was all part of something it had done a thousand times before.\n\nMy phone light caught Casey's jacket ahead, that bright red. I focused on it, used it as a beacon. We were running uphill now, the ground getting steeper, roots reaching across the path like fingers trying to trip us. My thighs burned. My ankle throbbed with each impact.\n\nThen Casey went down.\n\nShe cried out, a sharp yelp of pain, and Luke skidded to a stop. I nearly crashed into him. Casey was on the ground, clutching her leg, her phone a few feet away casting crazy shadows across her face.\n\n\"I can't,\" she gasped. \"My ankle, I can't.\"\n\nLuke looked back. Even in the bad light, I could see his face. The calculation happening there. The math of who lives and who dies.\n\n\"Help me get her up,\" I said, moving to Casey's other side.\n\nWe each took an arm, hauled her to her feet. She whimpered, tried to put weight on her right leg and nearly collapsed again. Luke and I locked our arms behind her back, made a kind of chair. She looped her arms around our necks.\n\nWe moved slower now. So much slower. Casey's weight between us, her breathing ragged in my ear. The creature's rattling got louder. Closer. I could feel its presence like a pressure change, like the air itself was being displaced by something too large, too wrong.\n\n\"There,\" Luke panted. \"I see the fence.\"\n\nAnd there it was, chain-link glinting in our phone lights, and beyond it, the dark mass of the hospital. We were coming at it from an angle, not the way we'd entered. This section of fence was intact but there was a spot maybe ten yards down where it had been peeled back.\n\nWe staggered toward it, Casey's weight making every step feel like we were wading through concrete. Five yards. Three.\n\nBehind us, branches cracked. Not the small pops of twigs breaking. The deep groan of something large pushing through resistance. I risked a look back.\n\nThe creature had closed the distance. It was right there, maybe fifteen feet away, and in the better light near the fence line I could see it clearly for the first time.\n\nIt wasn't wearing the moss and rot. That was its skin. Bark and organic material fused together into something that might have once been alive but had evolved past that into something else. The deer skull was partially embedded in its body, grown into it, and where the skull ended and the body began was impossible to determine. The antlers weren't antlers at all. They were bones. Human bones. Femurs and radius and ulna, all twisted and fused together into that branching structure.\n\nAnd the worst part, the part that made my bladder almost let go, was that the skull was moving. Not the creature's head, but the skull itself. The jaw was opening and closing in a rhythm that matched the rattling of the bone necklace, and I could see something behind the bone. Something dark and writhing, like the inside of the skull was full of worms or maggots or things that squirmed.\n\n\"Go, go, GO!\" I screamed.\n\nWe hit the fence line. Luke dropped Casey's arm, grabbed the peeled-back section and hauled it up. The metal shrieked. Casey went under first, on her hands and knees, crawling. I was right behind her, and behind me I could hear the creature moving faster now, could hear that rattling building to a crescendo.\n\nI was halfway under when I felt something grab my jacket. Not a hand. Nothing as simple as a hand. Something that felt like it had too many points of contact, like it was gripping me in six places at once. The fabric pulled taut, yanking me backward, and I screamed.\n\nCasey was on the other side, reaching back through, grabbing my arms. Luke was there too, pulling. I was caught between them, the fence cutting into my back, the creature's grip tightening. I could smell it now. Rot and earth and something sweet underneath, like decomposition, like meat going bad in the sun.\n\nMy jacket tore.\n\nThe sound was loud, that ripping canvas noise, and suddenly I was sliding forward, under the fence, Luke and Casey falling backward with me on top. We landed in a heap on the asphalt. I rolled, looked back.\n\nThe creature was pressed against the fence. Not trying to climb it or break through. Just standing there, that deer skull tilted, watching us. The bone necklace had gone still. In the parking lot lights, I could see my jacket, or what was left of it, hanging from one of the fence posts. It was shredded. Not cut. Shredded, like something with claws had grabbed it.\n\nBut the creature had no hands.\n\n\"Come on,\" Luke said, already pulling Casey to her feet. \"The hospital. We get inside, we're safe.\"\n\nI didn't know what made him think that. Didn't know what made him think we'd be safe anywhere. But the alternative was standing here in the parking lot while that thing watched us, so I got up and ran.\n\nThe hospital entrance gaped open. Someone had torn the boards off years ago. Inside was darkness, deeper than the forest, and that smell. Mold and decay and stale air that hadn't moved in decades. Our phones lit the way, catching on debris. A wheelchair, rusted, one wheel missing. Medical charts scattered across the floor, patient names still visible. An IV stand lying on its side.\n\nWe moved into the lobby, a wide open space with a reception desk that had been stripped of anything valuable. The floor was tile, broken in places, and our footsteps echoed wrong. Too loud. Like the building was paying attention.\n\n\"We can't stay here,\" Casey said. She was limping badly, putting almost no weight on her right leg. \"It'll come in. It'll find us.\"\n\n\"Then we go up,\" Luke said, gesturing to a stairwell on the far side of the lobby. \"Get to the second floor, find a room we can barricade.\"\n\n\"Or we go straight through,\" I said, pointing to a hallway that led deeper into the building. \"Find the other side, get back to the parking lot. Get to the car.\"\n\nLuke looked at Casey, then at me. I saw the decision forming. Saw the exact moment he chose.\n\n\"Through is faster,\" he said, already moving toward the hallway.\n\nWe followed. Casey between us again, hobbling, trying to keep up. The hallway was narrower than the lobby, doors lining both sides. Most were closed. Some hung open, revealing rooms full of stripped beds and broken equipment. Our phone lights made everything worse, turning shadows into threats, making every corner a potential ambush.\n\nWe passed a nurse's station. The desk was overturned, papers everywhere, and something had made a nest in the corner. I couldn't tell what. Blankets and trash and something else, something organic that I didn't want to look at too closely.\n\nThen we heard it behind us.\n\nThat rattling.\n\nInside the building now. In the lobby. The sound echoed off the walls, distorted, making it impossible to tell exactly where it was coming from. But it was close. Getting closer.\n\n\"Faster,\" Luke hissed.\n\nCasey was crying again, quiet sobs that she was trying to muffle. We were moving as fast as we could, but her ankle was bad, really bad, and each step was agony for her. I could feel it in the way she gripped my shoulder, nails digging in through my shirt.\n\nThe hallway branched. Luke took the left corridor without hesitating. We followed. This hallway was darker somehow, fewer windows, and the air felt thicker. Harder to breathe. Like the building's decay had concentrated here.\n\nBehind us, the rattling got louder. I risked a look back and saw nothing but darkness and the pathetic throw of our phone lights. But I could feel it. That presence. That wrongness.\n\n\"There,\" Luke said, pointing ahead.\n\nA door. Different from the others. Metal instead of wood, with a small window set at eye level. Emergency exit, maybe. A way out. We stumbled toward it, Casey whimpering with each step, and Luke hit it at full speed.\n\nIt didn't budge.\n\nHe slammed into it, bounced back, tried the handle. Locked. He threw his shoulder against it again, and again, and the door rattled in its frame but held.\n\n\"Fuck,\" he said. \"Fuck, fuck, FUCK.\"\n\nThe rattling was louder now. So loud it seemed to come from the walls themselves. I turned, putting myself between Casey and the direction we'd come, and my phone light caught movement at the end of the hallway.\n\nThe creature was there.\n\nIt had to hunch to fit in the corridor, that deer skull scraping the ceiling tiles. Bits of acoustic foam rained down as it moved, and the sound of its passage was wrong. Wet and grinding, like meat being forced through a space too small.\n\n\"Luke,\" I said, and my voice was surprisingly steady. \"We need to move.\"\n\n\"The door's locked!\"\n\n\"Then we find another door!\"\n\nLuke grabbed Casey's arm and pulled her away from the exit. We ran back the way we'd come, but the creature was blocking that path now, so we took the first door we came to. It opened into a patient room, and we slammed it shut behind us.\n\nThe room was small. A single bed, stripped to the frame. A window with bars on it, glass long gone, letting in cold air and the smell of the forest. A small bathroom in the corner, door hanging off one hinge.\n\n\"We're trapped,\" Casey said. She'd given up trying to stop crying. Tears tracked down her face, catching in our phone lights. \"We're trapped and it's going to kill us.\"\n\n\"There has to be another way out,\" I said, moving to the window. The bars were solid, old but not rusted enough to break. I shook them anyway. They didn't move.\n\nBehind us, in the hallway, the rattling had stopped.\n\nThe silence was worse. So much worse. Because silence meant it was listening. Hunting. Planning.\n\nLuke was at the door, ear pressed against it, trying to hear movement. His hand was on the handle, knuckles white.\n\n\"I don't hear anything,\" he whispered.\n\n\"That doesn't mean it's not there,\" Casey said.\n\nWe waited. Seconds that felt like hours. My heart was beating so hard I could feel it in my throat, in my temples. The cold air from the window made me shiver, or maybe that was just fear. Probably fear.\n\nThen something scraped against the door.\n\nNot a knock. A long, drawn-out scrape, like bone on metal. The door shuddered. Luke jumped back, nearly dropping his phone.\n\nThe scraping came again, lower this time. Then higher. Like the thing was testing the door, learning its dimensions.\n\nThe handle started to turn.\n\nLuke grabbed it, tried to hold it, but the force on the other side was immense. The handle turned despite his grip, despite him throwing his weight against it, and the door began to open.\n\n\"Help me!\" Luke screamed.\n\nI ran to the door, added my weight. Casey was there too, her bad ankle forgotten, all of us pressing against the door as it slowly, inexorably, opened. It was like trying to hold back a freight train. Like trying to stop gravity.\n\nThe door opened six inches. Then a foot. Through the gap, I could see the hallway, and I could see the creature.\n\nIt had changed. Or maybe I was just seeing it more clearly. The deer skull was at ground level now, and I realized the creature didn't have a fixed orientation. It could move in any direction, could reorient itself however it needed. The skull was sideways now, antlers scraping the doorframe, and behind it, that body of moss and rot and wrong, and in the darkness behind the skull's eye sockets, I saw movement. Saw things writhing.\n\nThe door opened another foot.\n\n\"The bathroom!\" Casey screamed. \"Go, go!\"\n\nWe broke, all of us at once, abandoning the door and sprinting for the bathroom. It was tiny, barely enough room for the three of us, but we crammed inside and Luke grabbed the door. This one was lighter, flimsier, but it had a lock. He turned it just as the patient room door slammed open behind us.\n\nThe creature filled the doorway.\n\nThrough the crack at the bottom of the bathroom door, I could see it. Could see that mass of organic material spreading across the tile, and the shadow it cast was wrong. Too many angles. Too much depth.\n\nThen came the voice.\n\n\"Wish,\" it said, and the word rattled through the building. \"Must wish. All must wish.\"\n\nLuke's face was white. He was backed against the sink, hands gripping the porcelain like it was the only thing keeping him upright. Casey was in the corner, arms wrapped around herself, rocking slightly.\n\nThe door shuddered. Something hit it, heavy, and the wood cracked.\n\n\"Wish,\" the creature said again. \"You. Wish. NOW.\"\n\nThe door splintered. Wood shards exploded inward. A piece hit my arm, drawing blood. Through the hole in the door, I could see the deer skull, could see those empty sockets looking in at us.\n\nLuke's voice came out strangled, desperate.\n\n\"I wish you were dead,\" he said. \"I wish you were fucking dead.\"\n\nThe creature's response was immediate. The deer skull snapped back, and that rattling started again, frenzied, and Luke's hands flew to his back.\n\nHe screamed.\n\nNot like Ryan. Different. This was a scream of confusion more than pain, at least at first. Then the pain came. I watched his body arch backward, watched his shirt collapse inward like something was being pulled out from underneath, and I understood.\n\nThe creature was removing his spine.\n\nNot all at once. Bone by bone. Vertebra by vertebra. I could see them going, could see the shirt fabric cave where each bone disappeared. Luke's body bent backward, farther than any body should bend, and the scream went on and on until his lungs couldn't support it anymore and it became a wet gurgle.\n\nThen he fell.\n\nCasey was screaming. Had been screaming. I grabbed her, pulled her close, but she fought me. Pushed me away.\n\n\"No!\" she shouted at the creature. At the deer skull watching us through the broken door. \"I wish none of this ever happened! I wish we never came here!\"\n\nAnd the world broke.\n\nThat's the only way I can describe it. Reality fractured like glass, and through the cracks I could see something else. Other versions of this moment. Other timelines where we made different choices. Where we didn't come. Where we turned back. Where Ryan said something else. All of them existing simultaneously, overlapping, bleeding into each other.\n\nThe buzzing started in my skull, building and building until I thought my head would explode. The bathroom walls rippled like water. Casey was there and then not there and then there again, flickering like a broken film strip. The creature's rattling became a roar, became everything, became the only sound in existence.\n\nI fell.\n\nOr flew.\n\nOr both.\n\nTime inverted. Collapsed. Expanded. I saw Ryan's face caving in again but backward, saw it inflate like a balloon. Saw Luke's spine returning, then disappearing again. Saw Casey running, screaming, laughing, all at the same time.\n\nThen it stopped.\n\nComplete silence. Complete stillness.\n\nI was on my back, staring up at nothing. No, not nothing. Stars. I was staring at stars. My hands were on asphalt, cold and rough. I sat up slowly, carefully, like any sudden movement might shatter whatever fragile reality had formed around me.\n\nI was in the parking lot.\n\nNot near it. In it. Lying next to Luke's Camaro. The driver's side door hung open. The dome light was on, casting everything in sickly yellow.\n\nI stood. My legs shook but held. I turned slowly, taking it in. The parking lot. The hospital in the distance. The forest pressing against the fence line.\n\nAnd Luke's car.\n\nI knew before I looked. Somehow I knew. But I looked anyway.\n\nLuke was in the driver's seat. Slumped over the steering wheel, his body bent at an angle that was only possible because there was nothing inside to stop it bending that way. His shirt had collapsed inward, empty, and even from outside the car I could see the void where his spine should have been.\n\nI made a sound. Not quite a scream. Not quite a sob. Something in between.\n\nI walked around to the passenger side on legs that didn't feel like mine. Opened the door with hands that had forgotten how to shake.\n\nCasey was there.\n\nFolded in on herself like origami. Her torso compressed, caved in, her body bent over her knees in a way that revealed the complete absence of ribs. Her ribcage was gone. Removed. Taken as payment.\n\nHer head rested on the dashboard, eyes open but not seeing. Not anymore.\n\nI closed the door carefully. Gently. Like she might wake up if I made too much noise.\n\nRyan's bike was still there. Still propped against the light pole where he'd left it.\n\nRyan was next to it.\n\nI couldn't look at him. Not directly. My eyes skated away from what was left of his face, from the collapsed ruin of his skull. But I saw enough. I saw the bike visible through where his head used to be. Saw the way his body looked boneless, deflated.\n\nI sat down in the parking lot. Right there on the cold asphalt. And I laughed. Not because anything was funny. Just because something had to come out and laughter was what my body chose. It turned into crying pretty quickly. Then back to laughing. Then I couldn't tell which one I was doing anymore.\n\nEventually, I called 911.\n\nTold them there'd been an accident at County Memorial. They asked what kind of accident and I said, \"You need to come. Please just come.\"\n\nThe cops arrived first. Then the ambulances. Then more cops. They separated me from the bodies, wrapped me in a foil blanket, asked questions I couldn't answer. What happened? Where were you? What did you see?\n\nI told them the truth. All of it. The creature. The wishes. The hospital.\n\nThey wrote it down with the kind of careful attention people give the clearly insane.\n\nBy morning, I was in the back of a police car. By afternoon, I was in a psychiatric ward.\n\nThey were kind. That's what made it worse. Everyone so gentle, so understanding. Asking me about what I'd experienced, nodding when I talked about the creature, taking careful notes. The medications came in little cups, pills that made everything feel distant and manageable.\n\n\"It was a psychotic break,\" the doctor told me after the first week. \"Trauma manifesting as hallucination. You survived something terrible and your mind created a narrative to cope.\"\n\nI learned to agree with him. Learned to say the right things, to show the right amount of progress. Three months of good behavior, of taking the pills, of going to group therapy and pretending I believed what they believed.\n\nThen they approved an outing. A supervised trip back into the world.\n\n\"We think you're ready,\" the doctor said. \"Ready to reintegrate.\"\n\nI know where I'm going.\n\nI know what I'll do.\n\nThe creature said we all had to wish. Ryan did. Luke did. Casey did. But I never made mine. The creature is still waiting. It has to be. Those are the rules.\n\nI'll go back to those woods. I'll find it in the darkness between the trees. And I'll say the words that have been circling in my head for three months, the only wish that makes sense now.\n\nMaybe it won't work. Maybe the creature is gone, maybe the rules don't function that way, maybe I'm just crazy after all and I'll wander those woods until I die of exposure.\n\nBut I have to try.\n\nBecause this, right here, breathing and walking and pretending to be alive while they're in the ground, this is the real horror. This is the real price.\n\nAnd tomorrow, I'm going to pay it.",

    "content": "The thing about Ryan was that he never committed to anything scary. Horror movies were out. Roller coasters were out. Even choosing colleges stressed him out because it meant closing doors, making something real and final. His therapist called it 'decision paralysis.' I called it self-preservation. When your dad walks out and your mom stops getting out of bed, you learn that some questions are better left unasked.\n\nI understood that. Ryan's mom had the kind of depression that kept the curtains drawn for weeks at a time. His dad left when Ryan was eleven, and the last thing the guy said before walking out was that Ryan needed to \"man up and help your mother.\" So Ryan learned to be quiet. To fade into the background of rooms. To make himself small enough that his presence wouldn't be another burden for anyone to carry.\n\nCasey was the opposite. She took up space like she'd been told her whole life she deserved to. Student council, debate team, Instagram aesthetic so carefully curated it looked effortless. Her parents were the kind of people who showed up to every event with professional cameras, who had her entire academic future mapped out on a literal poster board in their home office. Yale, then law school, then partnership in her father's firm.\n\nThe thing was, Casey actually wanted none of that. She'd told me once, sophomore year, that she wished she could just work in a plant nursery. Spend her days with her hands in dirt, helping things grow. But she'd said it like it was a joke, like the idea of disappointing her parents was so unthinkable it could only exist as fantasy.\n\nAnd Luke. Luke was more complicated than I wanted him to be.\n\nHe was tall, yeah. Played varsity football. Had the kind of easy confidence that came from never being told he couldn't do something. But here's the thing nobody else seemed to notice: Luke's dad hit him. Not often enough to leave marks that lasted, but enough. I'd seen Luke flinch once when Ryan clapped him on the shoulder too suddenly. Seen the way he stood sometimes, favoring his left side like his ribs were sore. He never talked about it, and I never asked, but it was there between us like smoke.\n\nThat's why he cheated on Casey, probably. Self-sabotage as a kind of protection. If you ruin it first, nobody can take it from you. I understood the logic even if I hated what it did to her. Even if watching her take him back felt like watching someone walk into traffic.\n\nMe? I was just trying to get through high school without my own damage becoming everyone else's problem.\n\nThe folklore started on a Reddit thread. Someone's uncle's coworker knew a guy who'd gone into the woods behind County Memorial and come back wrong. Different. Kept talking about prices and payments and how everything cost something. Three weeks later, he drove his truck into the lake with his whole family inside.\n\n\"It's bullshit,\" Ryan had said when Casey first brought it up, but his fingers were already drumming that nervous pattern on his knee. The one that meant he was thinking about it too hard, letting it get under his skin.\n\n\"Probably,\" Casey said. She was scrolling through satellite images of the hospital on her phone, zooming in on the forest that pressed against its southern edge. \"But wouldn't it be cool to check out? Just the hospital, I mean. Urban exploration.\"\n\nThe hospital had been abandoned since 2003. County Memorial, built in the forties, shut down after some Medicare fraud thing bankrupted the board. Six stories of brick and broken windows, wrapped in chain-link and covered in the kind of graffiti that suggested people came here specifically to be forgotten. The forest beyond it was old growth pine, dense enough that hikers got lost every few years. Search parties, helicopters, the whole production. Sometimes they found the bodies.\n\nWe were standing by Casey's locker between third and fourth period when she pitched the idea. Ryan looked like he wanted to crawl into the ventilation system. I was trying to figure out how to say no without sounding as scared as I felt when Luke appeared.\n\nHe had this way of moving through crowds like they were designed to part for him. People just stepped aside. He came up behind Casey and wrapped his arms around her waist, lifting her off her feet. She shrieked, kicking her legs, laughing in that way that made my stomach hurt.\n\n\"What are we talking about?\" Luke asked, setting her down.\n\nCasey turned in his arms, already grinning. \"The hospital. The one with the woods out back. We're thinking of exploring it.\"\n\n\"Sounds boring,\" Luke said, but he was looking at me when he said it, one eyebrow raised. \"Unless you're afraid.\"\n\nThere it was. The hook. Luke knew exactly what he was doing. He'd been doing it since middle school, this casual needling that made saying no feel like admitting weakness. It was manipulative and obvious and it worked anyway because I was seventeen and stupid.\n\n\"Tonight,\" I said. \"Seven o'clock.\"\n\nLuke smiled. Ryan looked like he might throw up.\n\nI told my parents I was sleeping at Ryan's. They barely looked up from their respective screens. My dad worked in insurance, my mom taught elementary school, and both of them seemed relieved I had friends to occupy my time. Teenagers were a mystery they'd decided not to solve.\n\nI climbed out my bedroom window at six thirty, dropping into the backyard with an impact that made my ankles ache. My bike was old, inherited from a cousin, and the chain made a clicking sound that seemed too loud in the quiet suburban evening. I texted Ryan that I was heading out. He sent back a thumbs up and nothing else.\n\nThe hospital was four miles away, past the nice part of town and into the part where houses had bars on the windows. The sun was setting, turning the sky the color of a bruise. By the time I reached the parking lot, full dark had fallen.\n\nThe place looked worse than the photos suggested. The fog was real, thick enough that it pooled in low spots like something liquid. The hospital loomed beyond it, all those shattered windows like eye sockets in a skull. Someone had painted \"MEMENTO MORI\" across the main entrance in dripping red letters.\n\nMy breath came out in clouds. October in New England, the kind of cold that got into your bones and stayed there. I tried Ryan's phone. It went straight to voicemail. Casey's rang four times and went to her cheerful recording.\n\nI took a photo. Posted it to Instagram with the caption \"bad decisions loading...\" and watched it get three likes before I'd even pocketed my phone.\n\nHeadlights swept across the lot. Luke's Camaro, black and impractical, his dad's castoff. The engine ticked as it cooled. Luke climbed out first, Casey from the passenger side. She was wearing his letterman jacket over her hoodie, drowning in it.\n\n\"Jesus,\" Luke said, breath fogging. \"It's freezing. Remind me why we're doing this?\"\n\n\"Adventure,\" Casey said, but she'd lost some of that enthusiasm from earlier. She looked small in the empty parking lot, younger than usual.\n\n\"Ryan's not here yet,\" I said.\n\nLuke snorted. \"Probably chickened out.\"\n\nThen we heard the bike. Ryan came pedaling into the lot like he was being chased, skidding to a stop next to mine. His helmet was crooked, his face flushed red from cold and exertion.\n\n\"Where the hell were you?\" I asked. \"I called.\"\n\n\"Got lost,\" Ryan panted. \"No signal out here. Everything looks the same in the dark.\"\n\nCasey was staring at the hospital now, really looking at it. \"Maybe this is stupid,\" she said quietly. \"Maybe we should just go home.\"\n\n\"We drove all the way out here,\" Luke said. He was already walking toward the building, hands shoved in his jacket pockets. \"Come on.\"\n\nWe followed the fence line around to the back. Up close, the hospital felt worse. Bigger. More present. Like it was aware of us in some fundamental way. The windows on the ground floor were boarded over, but higher up they gaped open, and I kept expecting to see movement in them. A face. A hand.\n\nRyan was breathing too fast, that panicky rhythm that meant he was spiraling. I'd seen it before, usually during tests or when his mom called during school.\n\nThe forest pressed against the fence, trees so dense they looked solid. Pine and oak and something that made the air smell like decay. We found a spot where someone had cut the chain link and peeled it back like the lid on a can.\n\n\"So we're really doing this?\" Casey asked. Nobody answered.\n\nLuke went first, ducking through. Then Casey. Then me and Ryan, who looked like he was walking to his execution.\n\nThe forest was colder. That shouldn't have been possible, but it was. Our phone lights made narrow tunnels in the dark, catching on bark and exposed roots and something that might have been animal bones. We walked single file, nobody speaking. There was no path. Just trees and darkness and the sound of our breathing.\n\nFive minutes in, Luke stopped.\n\n\"This is stupid,\" he said. \"There's nothing here. Let's go back, check out the hospital instead.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Casey said quickly. \"The hospital. Better idea.\"\n\nWe turned around. That's when something moved in the trees behind us.\n\nHeavy. Deliberate. The sound of something large displacing air. Casey backed into Luke, grabbing his arm. Ryan had gone statue-still, and when I looked at him, his face had lost all color.\n\n\"Animal,\" Luke said, but his voice was wrong. Too high.\n\nThe thing moved again. Closer. And with it came a sound like wind chimes made of bone, a clicking rattle that made my teeth ache.\n\nIt stepped into the light.\n\nI want to tell you I processed what I was seeing. That my brain took in the details and categorized them in any useful way. But that's not what happened. What happened was my mind just stopped, like a computer program hitting a fatal error.\n\nSeven feet tall, maybe more. A shape that suggested a body but refused to confirm one. Draped in moss and forest rot, organic material that might have been fabric or flesh or something in between. And the head. God. A deer skull, bleached white, antlers spreading like broken fingers. Around its neck, strung on what looked like sinew, hung dozens of teeth. Human teeth, maybe. Or animal. The distinction seemed less important than the fact of their existence.\n\nIt had no eyes but I felt it looking at us. Looking into us.\n\nLuke made a sound I'd never heard him make before, something between a sob and a laugh.\n\nThe thing's jaw opened. Not like a jaw should, but hinging wrong, too wide, and when it spoke, the voice came from everywhere and nowhere. From inside my skull and from the ground and from the air itself.\n\n\"You come to wish.\"\n\nThe words scraped like rusted metal dragging across bone.\n\n\"All of you must wish.\"\n\nCasey was crying. I could hear it, small hitching sobs behind me, but I couldn't turn to look at her. Couldn't stop staring at the creature, at the way it seemed to shift and settle like it wasn't quite solid, wasn't quite real.\n\nThe skull twitched toward Ryan.\n\nRyan opened his mouth. Closed it. His hands were shaking so badly I could see it even in the bad light.\n\n\"Wish,\" the creature said, and its voice got louder, resonant, shaking the trees. \"WISH NOW.\"\n\n\"I wish,\" Ryan started, then stopped. His voice was barely a whisper. \"I wish to know if God is real.\"\n\nI don't know what I expected. Maybe nothing. Maybe for the thing to laugh or vanish or tell us we were all idiots playing with urban legends. But that's not what happened.\n\nThe creature convulsed. Its body, that shapeless mass, began twitching violently, and the deer skull lurched sideways at an angle that made my stomach turn. The bone necklace rattled in the opposite direction, spinning, and the sound it made was like grinding vertebrae.\n\nRyan screamed.\n\nNot a shout or a yell. A scream. The kind that carries agony and terror in equal measure, that sounds like someone being unmade at the molecular level. His hands shot to his head, fingers clawing at his skull, and then I saw it happen.\n\nHis head was collapsing inward.\n\nThe bones of his skull were folding like paper, caving in on themselves, and his face, Ryan's face, the one I'd known since we were twelve, was disappearing into the void it left behind. The skin went slack and then concave, and the scream cut off into something wet and horrible and then into nothing at all.\n\nHe hit the ground.\n\nCasey's scream replaced his, raw and primal. Luke grabbed her arm hard enough to bruise.\n\n\"Run,\" he said.\n\nWe ran.\n\nI crashed through a low hanging branch that whipped across my face, bark scraping my cheek raw. My phone was in my hand, light jerking wildly, turning the forest into a strobe nightmare of trees and shadows and nothing that made sense. Behind us, I could hear it. That rattling. Bone on bone, getting closer.\n\nCasey was sobbing as she ran, these gasping, hitching breaths between footfalls. Luke was ahead of her, pulling her by the wrist, and I was behind them both, and I couldn't stop thinking about Ryan. About the way his face had just collapsed, folded in on itself like wet cardboard.\n\nMy foot caught on a root and I went down hard, phone flying from my hand. The impact knocked the air from my lungs. I scrabbled in the dirt, fingers finding leaves and moss and something that felt horribly like bone before my hand closed around the phone.\n\nThe light was facing back the way we'd come.\n\nThe creature was there.\n\nNot far. Maybe twenty feet. Moving through the trees with that horrible fluid motion, branches bending around it like they were afraid to touch it. The deer skull was angled toward me, antlers scraping bark, and the bone necklace swayed and clattered with each movement.\n\nI could see details now that I hadn't before. The way the moss covering its body seemed to grow and shift, pulsing like something alive. The teeth on the necklace weren't all the same size. Some were small, child-sized. Others were long and pointed, predator teeth. And there were other things strung between them. Small bones. Finger bones maybe. And something that looked horrifyingly like a dried human ear.\n\n\"GET UP!\" Luke's voice, somewhere ahead in the darkness.\n\nI rolled onto my hands and knees, pushed myself up. My ankle screamed in protest but held. I ran.\n\nThe forest had become a maze. Every tree looked the same. Every shadow held something terrible. My lungs burned. The cold air felt like breathing broken glass. I could hear Luke and Casey ahead, crashing through undergrowth, and I pushed harder, trying to catch up.\n\nBehind me, that rattling never stopped. It stayed constant, rhythmic, like the creature was pacing itself. Like it knew it didn't need to rush. Like this was all part of something it had done a thousand times before.\n\nMy phone light caught Casey's jacket ahead, that bright red. I focused on it, used it as a beacon. We were running uphill now, the ground getting steeper, roots reaching across the path like fingers trying to trip us. My thighs burned. My ankle throbbed with each impact.\n\nThen Casey went down.\n\nShe cried out, a sharp yelp of pain, and Luke skidded to a stop. I nearly crashed into him. Casey was on the ground, clutching her leg, her phone a few feet away casting crazy shadows across her face.\n\n\"I can't,\" she gasped. \"My ankle, I can't.\"\n\nLuke looked back. Even in the bad light, I could see his face. The calculation happening there. The math of who lives and who dies.\n\n\"Help me get her up,\" I said, moving to Casey's other side.\n\nWe each took an arm, hauled her to her feet. She whimpered, tried to put weight on her right leg and nearly collapsed again. Luke and I locked our arms behind her back, made a kind of chair. She looped her arms around our necks.\n\nWe moved slower now. So much slower. Casey's weight between us, her breathing ragged in my ear. The creature's rattling got louder. Closer. I could feel its presence like a pressure change, like the air itself was being displaced by something too large, too wrong.\n\n\"There,\" Luke panted. \"I see the fence.\"\n\nAnd there it was, chain-link glinting in our phone lights, and beyond it, the dark mass of the hospital. We were coming at it from an angle, not the way we'd entered. This section of fence was intact but there was a spot maybe ten yards down where it had been peeled back.\n\nWe staggered toward it, Casey's weight making every step feel like we were wading through concrete. Five yards. Three.\n\nBehind us, branches cracked. Not the small pops of twigs breaking. The deep groan of something large pushing through resistance. I risked a look back.\n\nThe creature had closed the distance. It was right there, maybe fifteen feet away, and in the better light near the fence line I could see it clearly for the first time.\n\nIt wasn't wearing the moss and rot. That was its skin. Bark and organic material fused together into something that might have once been alive but had evolved past that into something else. The deer skull was partially embedded in its body, grown into it, and where the skull ended and the body began was impossible to determine. The antlers weren't antlers at all. They were bones. Human bones. Femurs and radius and ulna, all twisted and fused together into that branching structure.\n\nAnd the worst part, the part that made my bladder almost let go, was that the skull was moving. Not the creature's head, but the skull itself. The jaw was opening and closing in a rhythm that matched the rattling of the bone necklace, and I could see something behind the bone. Something dark and writhing, like the inside of the skull was full of worms or maggots or things that squirmed.\n\n\"Go, go, GO!\" I screamed.\n\nWe hit the fence line. Luke dropped Casey's arm, grabbed the peeled-back section and hauled it up. The metal shrieked. Casey went under first, on her hands and knees, crawling. I was right behind her, and behind me I could hear the creature moving faster now, could hear that rattling building to a crescendo.\n\nI was halfway under when I felt something grab my jacket. Not a hand. Nothing as simple as a hand. Something that felt like it had too many points of contact, like it was gripping me in six places at once. The fabric pulled taut, yanking me backward, and I screamed.\n\nCasey was on the other side, reaching back through, grabbing my arms. Luke was there too, pulling. I was caught between them, the fence cutting into my back, the creature's grip tightening. I could smell it now. Rot and earth and something sweet underneath, like decomposition, like meat going bad in the sun.\n\nMy jacket tore.\n\nThe sound was loud, that ripping canvas noise, and suddenly I was sliding forward, under the fence, Luke and Casey falling backward with me on top. We landed in a heap on the asphalt. I rolled, looked back.\n\nThe creature was pressed against the fence. Not trying to climb it or break through. Just standing there, that deer skull tilted, watching us. The bone necklace had gone still. In the parking lot lights, I could see my jacket, or what was left of it, hanging from one of the fence posts. It was shredded. Not cut. Shredded, like something with claws had grabbed it.\n\nBut the creature had no hands.\n\n\"Come on,\" Luke said, already pulling Casey to her feet. \"The hospital. We get inside, we're safe.\"\n\nI didn't know what made him think that. Didn't know what made him think we'd be safe anywhere. But the alternative was standing here in the parking lot while that thing watched us, so I got up and ran.\n\nThe hospital entrance gaped open. Someone had torn the boards off years ago. Inside was darkness, deeper than the forest, and that smell. Mold and decay and stale air that hadn't moved in decades. Our phones lit the way, catching on debris. A wheelchair, rusted, one wheel missing. Medical charts scattered across the floor, patient names still visible. An IV stand lying on its side.\n\nWe moved into the lobby, a wide open space with a reception desk that had been stripped of anything valuable. The floor was tile, broken in places, and our footsteps echoed wrong. Too loud. Like the building was paying attention.\n\n\"We can't stay here,\" Casey said. She was limping badly, putting almost no weight on her right leg. \"It'll come in. It'll find us.\"\n\n\"Then we go up,\" Luke said, gesturing to a stairwell on the far side of the lobby. \"Get to the second floor, find a room we can barricade.\"\n\n\"Or we go straight through,\" I said, pointing to a hallway that led deeper into the building. \"Find the other side, get back to the parking lot. Get to the car.\"\n\nLuke looked at Casey, then at me. I saw the decision forming. Saw the exact moment he chose.\n\n\"Through is faster,\" he said, already moving toward the hallway.\n\nWe followed. Casey between us again, hobbling, trying to keep up. The hallway was narrower than the lobby, doors lining both sides. Most were closed. Some hung open, revealing rooms full of stripped beds and broken equipment. Our phone lights made everything worse, turning shadows into threats, making every corner a potential ambush.\n\nWe passed a nurse's station. The desk was overturned, papers everywhere, and something had made a nest in the corner. I couldn't tell what. Blankets and trash and something else, something organic that I didn't want to look at too closely.\n\nThen we heard it behind us.\n\nThat rattling.\n\nInside the building now. In the lobby. The sound echoed off the walls, distorted, making it impossible to tell exactly where it was coming from. But it was close. Getting closer.\n\n\"Faster,\" Luke hissed.\n\nCasey was crying again, quiet sobs that she was trying to muffle. We were moving as fast as we could, but her ankle was bad, really bad, and each step was agony for her. I could feel it in the way she gripped my shoulder, nails digging in through my shirt.\n\nThe hallway branched. Luke took the left corridor without hesitating. We followed. This hallway was darker somehow, fewer windows, and the air felt thicker. Harder to breathe. Like the building's decay had concentrated here.\n\nBehind us, the rattling got louder. I risked a look back and saw nothing but darkness and the pathetic throw of our phone lights. But I could feel it. That presence. That wrongness.\n\n\"There,\" Luke said, pointing ahead.\n\nA door. Different from the others. Metal instead of wood, with a small window set at eye level. Emergency exit, maybe. A way out. We stumbled toward it, Casey whimpering with each step, and Luke hit it at full speed.\n\nIt didn't budge.\n\nHe slammed into it, bounced back, tried the handle. Locked. He threw his shoulder against it again, and again, and the door rattled in its frame but held.\n\n\"Fuck,\" he said. \"Fuck, fuck, FUCK.\"\n\nThe rattling was louder now. So loud it seemed to come from the walls themselves. I turned, putting myself between Casey and the direction we'd come, and my phone light caught movement at the end of the hallway.\n\nThe creature was there.\n\nIt had to hunch to fit in the corridor, that deer skull scraping the ceiling tiles. Bits of acoustic foam rained down as it moved, and the sound of its passage was wrong. Wet and grinding, like meat being forced through a space too small.\n\n\"Luke,\" I said, and my voice was surprisingly steady. \"We need to move.\"\n\n\"The door's locked!\"\n\n\"Then we find another door!\"\n\nLuke grabbed Casey's arm and pulled her away from the exit. We ran back the way we'd come, but the creature was blocking that path now, so we took the first door we came to. It opened into a patient room, and we slammed it shut behind us.\n\nThe room was small. A single bed, stripped to the frame. A window with bars on it, glass long gone, letting in cold air and the smell of the forest. A small bathroom in the corner, door hanging off one hinge.\n\n\"We're trapped,\" Casey said. She'd given up trying to stop crying. Tears tracked down her face, catching in our phone lights. \"We're trapped and it's going to kill us.\"\n\n\"There has to be another way out,\" I said, moving to the window. The bars were solid, old but not rusted enough to break. I shook them anyway. They didn't move.\n\nBehind us, in the hallway, the rattling had stopped.\n\nThe silence was worse. So much worse. Because silence meant it was listening. Hunting. Planning.\n\nLuke was at the door, ear pressed against it, trying to hear movement. His hand was on the handle, knuckles white.\n\n\"I don't hear anything,\" he whispered.\n\n\"That doesn't mean it's not there,\" Casey said.\n\nWe waited. Seconds that felt like hours. My heart was beating so hard I could feel it in my throat, in my temples. The cold air from the window made me shiver, or maybe that was just fear. Probably fear.\n\nThen something scraped against the door.\n\nNot a knock. A long, drawn-out scrape, like bone on metal. The door shuddered. Luke jumped back, nearly dropping his phone.\n\nThe scraping came again, lower this time. Then higher. Like the thing was testing the door, learning its dimensions.\n\nThe handle started to turn.\n\nLuke grabbed it, tried to hold it, but the force on the other side was immense. The handle turned despite his grip, despite him throwing his weight against it, and the door began to open.\n\n\"Help me!\" Luke screamed.\n\nI ran to the door, added my weight. Casey was there too, her bad ankle forgotten, all of us pressing against the door as it slowly, inexorably, opened. It was like trying to hold back a freight train. Like trying to stop gravity.\n\nThe door opened six inches. Then a foot. Through the gap, I could see the hallway, and I could see the creature.\n\nIt had changed. Or maybe I was just seeing it more clearly. The deer skull was at ground level now, and I realized the creature didn't have a fixed orientation. It could move in any direction, could reorient itself however it needed. The skull was sideways now, antlers scraping the doorframe, and behind it, that body of moss and rot and wrong, and in the darkness behind the skull's eye sockets, I saw movement. Saw things writhing.\n\nThe door opened another foot.\n\n\"The bathroom!\" Casey screamed. \"Go, go!\"\n\nWe broke, all of us at once, abandoning the door and sprinting for the bathroom. It was tiny, barely enough room for the three of us, but we crammed inside and Luke grabbed the door. This one was lighter, flimsier, but it had a lock. He turned it just as the patient room door slammed open behind us.\n\nThe creature filled the doorway.\n\nThrough the crack at the bottom of the bathroom door, I could see it. Could see that mass of organic material spreading across the tile, and the shadow it cast was wrong. Too many angles. Too much depth.\n\nThen came the voice.\n\n\"Wish,\" it said, and the word rattled through the building. \"Must wish. All must wish.\"\n\nLuke's face was white. He was backed against the sink, hands gripping the porcelain like it was the only thing keeping him upright. Casey was in the corner, arms wrapped around herself, rocking slightly.\n\nThe door shuddered. Something hit it, heavy, and the wood cracked.\n\n\"Wish,\" the creature said again. \"You. Wish. NOW.\"\n\nThe door splintered. Wood shards exploded inward. A piece hit my arm, drawing blood. Through the hole in the door, I could see the deer skull, could see those empty sockets looking in at us.\n\nLuke's voice came out strangled, desperate.\n\n\"I wish you were dead,\" he said. \"I wish you were fucking dead.\"\n\nThe creature's response was immediate. The deer skull snapped back, and that rattling started again, frenzied, and Luke's hands flew to his back.\n\nHe screamed.\n\nNot like Ryan. Different. This was a scream of confusion more than pain, at least at first. Then the pain came. I watched his body arch backward, watched his shirt collapse inward like something was being pulled out from underneath, and I understood.\n\nThe creature was removing his spine.\n\nNot all at once. Bone by bone. Vertebra by vertebra. I could see them going, could see the shirt fabric cave where each bone disappeared. Luke's body bent backward, farther than any body should bend, and the scream went on and on until his lungs couldn't support it anymore and it became a wet gurgle.\n\nThen he fell.\n\nCasey was screaming. Had been screaming. I grabbed her, pulled her close, but she fought me. Pushed me away.\n\n\"No!\" she shouted at the creature. At the deer skull watching us through the broken door. \"I wish none of this ever happened! I wish we never came here!\"\n\nAnd the world broke.\n\nThat's the only way I can describe it. Reality fractured like glass, and through the cracks I could see something else. Other versions of this moment. Other timelines where we made different choices. Where we didn't come. Where we turned back. Where Ryan said something else. All of them existing simultaneously, overlapping, bleeding into each other.\n\nThe buzzing started in my skull, building and building until I thought my head would explode. The bathroom walls rippled like water. Casey was there and then not there and then there again, flickering like a broken film strip. The creature's rattling became a roar, became everything, became the only sound in existence.\n\nI fell.\n\nOr flew.\n\nOr both.\n\nTime inverted. Collapsed. Expanded. I saw Ryan's face caving in again but backward, saw it inflate like a balloon. Saw Luke's spine returning, then disappearing again. Saw Casey running, screaming, laughing, all at the same time.\n\nThen it stopped.\n\nComplete silence. Complete stillness.\n\nI was on my back, staring up at nothing. No, not nothing. Stars. I was staring at stars. My hands were on asphalt, cold and rough. I sat up slowly, carefully, like any sudden movement might shatter whatever fragile reality had formed around me.\n\nI was in the parking lot.\n\nNot near it. In it. Lying next to Luke's Camaro. The driver's side door hung open. The dome light was on, casting everything in sickly yellow.\n\nI stood. My legs shook but held. I turned slowly, taking it in. The parking lot. The hospital in the distance. The forest pressing against the fence line.\n\nAnd Luke's car.\n\nI knew before I looked. Somehow I knew. But I looked anyway.\n\nLuke was in the driver's seat. Slumped over the steering wheel, his body bent at an angle that was only possible because there was nothing inside to stop it bending that way. His shirt had collapsed inward, empty, and even from outside the car I could see the void where his spine should have been.\n\nI made a sound. Not quite a scream. Not quite a sob. Something in between.\n\nI walked around to the passenger side on legs that didn't feel like mine. Opened the door with hands that had forgotten how to shake.\n\nCasey was there.\n\nFolded in on herself like origami. Her torso compressed, caved in, her body bent over her knees in a way that revealed the complete absence of ribs. Her ribcage was gone. Removed. Taken as payment.\n\nHer head rested on the dashboard, eyes open but not seeing. Not anymore.\n\nI closed the door carefully. Gently. Like she might wake up if I made too much noise.\n\nRyan's bike was still there. Still propped against the light pole where he'd left it.\n\nRyan was next to it.\n\nI couldn't look at him. Not directly. My eyes skated away from what was left of his face, from the collapsed ruin of his skull. But I saw enough. I saw the bike visible through where his head used to be. Saw the way his body looked boneless, deflated.\n\nI sat down in the parking lot. Right there on the cold asphalt. And I laughed. Not because anything was funny. Just because something had to come out and laughter was what my body chose. It turned into crying pretty quickly. Then back to laughing. Then I couldn't tell which one I was doing anymore.\n\nEventually, I called 911.\n\nTold them there'd been an accident at County Memorial. They asked what kind of accident and I said, \"You need to come. Please just come.\"\n\nThe cops arrived first. Then the ambulances. Then more cops. They separated me from the bodies, wrapped me in a foil blanket, asked questions I couldn't answer. What happened? Where were you? What did you see?\n\nI told them the truth. All of it. The creature. The wishes. The hospital.\n\nThey wrote it down with the kind of careful attention people give the clearly insane.\n\nBy morning, I was in the back of a police car. By afternoon, I was in a psychiatric ward.\n\nThey were kind. That's what made it worse. Everyone so gentle, so understanding. Asking me about what I'd experienced, nodding when I talked about the creature, taking careful notes. The medications came in little cups, pills that made everything feel distant and manageable.\n\n\"It was a psychotic break,\" the doctor told me after the first week. \"Trauma manifesting as hallucination. You survived something terrible and your mind created a narrative to cope.\"\n\nI learned to agree with him. Learned to say the right things, to show the right amount of progress. Three months of good behavior, of taking the pills, of going to group therapy and pretending I believed what they believed.\n\nThen they approved an outing. A supervised trip back into the world.\n\n\"We think you're ready,\" the doctor said. \"Ready to reintegrate.\"\n\nI know where I'm going.\n\nI know what I'll do.\n\nThe creature said we all had to wish. Ryan did. Luke did. Casey did. But I never made mine. The creature is still waiting. It has to be. Those are the rules.\n\nI'll go back to those woods. I'll find it in the darkness between the trees. And I'll say the words that have been circling in my head for three months, the only wish that makes sense now.\n\nMaybe it won't work. Maybe the creature is gone, maybe the rules don't function that way, maybe I'm just crazy after all and I'll wander those woods until I die of exposure.\n\nBut I have to try.\n\nBecause this, right here, breathing and walking and pretending to be alive while they're in the ground, this is the real horror. This is the real price.\n\nAnd tomorrow, I'm going to pay it.",

    "content": "There is no peace deal between Israel & Hamas yet. God willing, there will be. But substantively nothing changed today or this week, compared to anything this administration has been doing all year. They are simply making announcements about parts of a deal being reached, with absolutely nothing new. It is not news.\n\nBut because the public has become accustomed to every single press release resulting in unprecedented responses or comments, you are conditioned to go with the line of the administration even if you mock it.\n\nOr disbelieve it.\n\nYou still acknowledge it.\n\nThis same phenomenon has been seen in the aftermath of the Charlie Kirk assassination, with people branding his legacy for their own cause or concerns, instead of surveying the moment and actually living in it. There is a level of authoritative reprimand that is composed by all people in the press and public life, which asserts that it knows what things mean for the future. In the present, as things are happening newly. That is not only arrogant, it is unnecessary for anybody who wants to know what is real or true and how to deal with it.\n\nIn the Kirk example, the alleged, accused, and currently on trial - Tyler Robinson - has been crafted into a historic figure.\n\nWhen he may be a patsy or a fall guy.\n\nOr he could be totally guilty.\n\nThere is no way of knowing.\n\nYet you have formed your opinion on a definite basis, in order probably to know - how to respond to people in your life or online - instead of remaining agnostic or undecided.\n\nThis happened to Luigi Mangione - or whatever the person you think is called that's name is - as he apparently was picked up with multiple ID's and the cops seemed to be planting evidence.\n\nIt happened to basically every perpetrator of acts of violence this year and for many years now. The people you are shown as guilty, are presented in such a way that you are left not questioning the right things, while taking the wrong things as fact. Unless you are a juror in a case, you are probably not going to get all the information.\n\nThat being the case, nobody knows what will be historic until - time passes - and nobody left alive from the period is left to tell the story. Then, the society will decide or be effected by those who choose to remember, and retell, those stories.\n\nPeople can claim they are historic, like you know who. It can even feel like that in the moment. It might even be, a historic moment. But, if you are too focused on performing your belief of this historic news event or that one, you become like the boy who cried wolf.\n\nAll of a sudden you are proclaiming things are a big deal, and debating their importance, instead of being an active participant in history and attempting to be remembered for something great. \n\nIf everything is historic, nothing is.\n\nAnd then the idea of history evaporates.\n\nAnd history gets erased.\n\nDon't erase history.\n\nStudy it.\n\nPreserve it.\n\nUnderstand it.\n\nDo not repeat it.\n\nDo not repeat it.\n\nDo not repeat it.\n\nDo not repeat it.",

    "content": "I've been looking for plays that are de-risking themselves while the rest of the market is choppy, and this one keeps popping up on my radar. It's a diagnostics company that has been quietly building major momentum in Europe while setting up its main show for the US.\n\nThe ticker is MYNZ (Mainz Biomed), and here's the quick cheat sheet on why it's worth a look right now, especially on market dips:\n\n1. Europe is Launching Now\n\nThey just secured UK market authorization (MHRA registration) for their flagship colorectal cancer (CRC) test, ColoAlert. That's a huge potential market! Plus, they officially launched commercially in Switzerland in September. This isn't future hope—it's execution that should start showing up in revenue soon.\n\n2. The US Path is Clear\n\nThe big one is their next-gen CRC test. They've given a clear roadmap:\n\n* Data Readout Coming: They plan to release the main results from their key clinical study (eAArly DETECT 2) in Q4 2025. This is the core catalyst everyone is waiting for.\n* Pivotal Study Next: That data will finalize the design for the big US pivotal study (ReconAAsense), which is set to start in 2026. This is the FDA pathway in action.\n\n3. Smart Expansion Beyond CRC\n\nThey aren't a one-trick pony. They're already working on a non-invasive, blood-based screening test for pancreatic cancer (PancAlert). The best part? They secured government funding to cover up to 50% of the project costs, which takes the pressure off their cash burn.\n\nWhile most pennies today are struggling to find a \"second leg\" without real news, MYNZ is checking boxes with real execution in Europe and has a massive Q4 2025 data catalyst looming for the US market.\n\nIn a slow session like this, I'm not chasing thin floats. I'd rather use weakness to build a position in a story that has a clear roadmap and fresh receipts, like MYNZ.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Are you looking for execution stories or sticking to technical-only plays today?\n\n\n\nPCSA JNJ NISN DRCT TOVX DELL VIVK AAPL ADBE AKAN OPEN IREN WDC EGAN LPTX NKE SOPA SOFI COCH BNAI STX ARBE AMD RKLB RYDE FLUT PHOE PRHI GSIW QCOM AEI COIN AMZN ANET DLXY ASTS CIIT ZNB ANY BURU CLRB BQ MARA AREC BKNG NOW CRM DVLT EDHL QS SHOP VRT RVSN QNCX ACHR EDSA TSLA FOFO OKUR ZBIO XBIO RNAZ LXEO SCWO CRVO SKYE BJDX YYAI BIAF CCTG YDKG CRWD BAC BGL APM LBGJ DSY CCTG INTU MTEN BA GLTO QTTB MRVL ANIX QUBT",

    "content": "I have an excellent example of how dividend investment works and the power of dividend re-investment plans. I did not mean for it to be an experiment, but it has turned out that way. \nI came into some cash in 2001 and in August I bought a spread of dividend stocks off of the Dividend Investing newsletter. The brokerage fees were obnoxious. One ofnthenstocks I bought was Johnson and Johnson. $JNJ 1 share for 54.93 with brokerage fees it was $70.43 total. Adjusted for inflation that would be $128.05 today. \nI never bought any other shares as I was focused on other stocks in my basket. (Yes you can flame me for that but it's turned out well, just a missed opportunity.\nAs of today I have 1.905 shares worth $365.02\nafter 24 years and $200 in 2001 dollars.. I'll take that. It hasn't all been gold, ask me about Washington Mutual. \nI have a few other examples. AT&T took some bizarre twists. Intel and Ford have been a Rollercoaster but they've made me money.  Best performers were General Mills, GE, and Tyson, mainly because I had a tax return or extra income during dips and increased my holdings. \n\nTLDR; DRIP works. Beats inflation and works out to 7.14% return. ",

    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nYesterday was wild for this stock. We saw a huge dip, then a massive 28% bounce back. I grabbed 1,500 shares near the bottom at $1.37 and I'm holding.\n\nI think this could easily push back up to the old range around $1.71-$1.75. That would be a nice quick swing trade.\n\nWhy the sudden confidence? Check the recent news! This company, Mainz Biomed (MYNZ), has been racking up wins in Europe.\n\n* They just launched their main cancer test in Switzerland (Sept 23, 2025). That means real money coming in from a new country now, not later.\n* They also got regulatory approval to sell in the U.K. (Sept 2, 2025) a huge market.\n* Plus, they locked in the timeline for their next-gen test data (Q4 2025) which is key for their path to the U.S. FDA.\n\nIt looks like the fundamentals are getting stronger right as the price is trying to recover.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is this just a dead cat bounce, or does the recent news give it the fuel to keep climbing?\n\n  \nJZXN RKT WETH V ACHR ACN SHOP LBGJ RKLB SLGL BNAI MU MIGI PC MA JNJ SOFI WBX TMO RNAZ ULY EGAN NISN BKSY SDOT PG BRN APP MSFT QNCX DRCT BA RITR SGLY HOOD DKNG IONQ GOOG ENGS SRPT BKKT SOPA IREN LINK BMNR OPEN COIN AMAT BURU SLNH SHMD GS AMBI BGL SPRB FPAY IMXI HCWB LRCX DLXY VZ DSY ASTS NITO TJX AVTX TOVX AGRZ HKPD AKAN ANET POET CIIT NXL RKLB TXN PRHI MRVL CAT AVGO NFLX YDKG VYNE QTTB QMCO PMAX CHAI TSLA ",

Boyinaband from bfb 23's title and got purple Face a new voice actor(which i don't think the new one has anything to do with yk), plus they started on Resort 7 when Birdie already passed Radio so they clearly care afterall.\n- They will likely ask on the poll \"should we do a winter season\" like they did with Natural 11\n- there might be a release either before tpot 20 or during tpot 20\n- I predict that this episode will be another 1+ minute long episode like natural 11 and resort 2\n- I also hope there is a past contestant cameo this episode\n",

I was given a panadein forte for a pain relief from my GP\n2. I tried to reduce my salt consumption, and drink more and more water.\n3. I eat many food with fiber.\n4. I avoid anything cold (water, etc)\n5. Tried to sleep as much as i could (eventhough its hard)\n\nActually things are getting better... until last night. The muscle pain is significantly decrease and previously i dont feel much itchiness. My doctor advise me that the itchiness is because of allergy, which also happen when i consume the panadein forte. So we stop it.\n\nLast night i only consume an antihistamine and paracetamol low dose.\n\nHowever, suddenly unfortunately its like back to 0. The itchiness is back like crazy and this morning its starting become pain. \n\nMy symptoms in general:\n1. Itchiness\n2. Pin needles sensation on my skin\n3. Muscle pain\n4. Extremely sensitive to cold\n5. No rash, but i see many very tiny bloodspot   \n6. No fever\n7. Cough\n8. I dont feel weak\n9. No headache \n10. No brain fog \n11. All bloodtest normal\n\nI want to ask you... what is your early symptom before you know you have fibromyalgia? Is it something that ALWAYS there or come and go? Honestly i was on hope before, but suddenly everything destroyed. I feel hopeless and heart broken because i feel like i'm back to 0 again. Just when i thought i can live normal again. \n\nI will meet my GP again today and want to ask for a referral to either an immunology & allergy specialist or rheumatologist.  \n\nWhat do you think? Thank you in advance for your reply. I really need that.. so much.. ",

The rally was fuelled by a renewed wave of **AI optimism** and easing rate expectations after recent Fed comments hinted at potential cuts later this year.   \n  \nDespite lingering concerns over a possible government shutdown, investors shrugged off macro worries and piled back into growth and tech.\n\nThe heatmap lit up green, led by semiconductors and big tech. **#AMD** exploded **+11%**, while **#NVDA** climbed **+2.2%** and **#AVGO** added **+2.7%**. **#AAPL** rose modestly at **+0.6%**, **#MSFT** edged slightly higher, **#META** ended in green while **#GOOGL** was the lone big-tech laggard, dipping **–0.5%**. Over in enterprise software, **#ORCL** and **#PLTR** gained on AI-related momentum, and in streaming, **#NFLX** tacked on nearly **+2%**.\n\n**#AMZN** led retail with a **+1.5%** pop, **#TSLA** bounced back **+1.3%**, and defensives like **#JNJ** and **#LLY** stayed steady. Finance was mostly red with **#JPM** **#BAC #WFC** and **#GS** while **#BRK.B** held firm.  \n  \nOverall, it was a risk-on day — traders rotated back into high-growth names as optimism returned to the AI trade.   \n  \nThe question now: is this the start of a new leg higher or just another frothy rally before earnings season kicks in?\n\nMoneyvize makes it easier to spot where strength and weakness are concentrated — whether you’re tracking daily movers or looking for value in recently sold-off names.

The price was hitting small roadblocks, but quickly breaking past them, with lots of people ready to buy the dips. This tells us the move has momentum, not that it's about to stop.\n\nWhat used to be a tough price to pass is now becoming the new lowest point. The trading data suggests new money is coming into the stock, not just long-time investors selling all their shares.\n\nWhy the sudden interest? The company has been doing well:\n\n* Their revenue shot up overcompared to last year.\n* They are growing their business (expanding routes and fuel stations).\n* They have new contracts for healthcare power systems that promise steady income.\n* They have a big campus in Florida ready for more growth.\n* The company is spending less money (saving aboutmillion a month).\n* Insiders (people who work there) are buying the stock.\n\nSo, here's the game plan for today:\n\n* If the price dips early, it should stay aboveto.\n* The next big price goal is , and if it clears that, it might run up to or.\n* If the stock closes below forminutes, it might drop back to before buyers step in again.\n\nAre you planning to buy on the way up, or wait for that lower price area to reload?\n\n  \nBJDX ANET HD HUMA SOFI BMEA PHOE MSTR BNBX SRPT EGAN AKAN JNJ TNMG FLUT PYPL YYAI UNH THH GPUS PRHI ZBIO BGL SGLY LBGJ WMT GWAV PWM MSN ZONE AGRZ BENF XBIO QNCX POET ABBV PG EPWK JPM VELO EDHL AMZN TSLA AUST CLIK BGMS RNAZ UPC MSGY MGIH HCWB MSPR SKYE SMTK WBX CCTG LRCX TJX APP REKR DRCT SDOT NFLX ADBE SNOW NISN SFHG COIN BKSY VRT AEI OKUR PMAX CCHH XOM INDP ANIX NOW HIMS CLRB APM SHOP SCWO ELAB TRUE BURU ",

    "content": "Hey Reddit, when people talk about NXXT blasting through resistance, it's more of a gradual grind. Supply's wearing thin because each hit on old highs leads to better lows, climbing MAs, and snappy recoveries - sellers either show up or bail.\n\nWatch for these: \n\n(1) former highs flipping to supports on dips; \n\n(2) volume surging on climbs and easing on drops; \n\n(3) no sharp lower lows on 10/30-min charts. \n\nWhile that's in play, these runs can keep circling back to highs over a week. Fueling's ramping, microgrid LOIs are gearing for PPAs, campus has 200 MW upside, burn's down $1M/month, and insiders are committed - enough to eye a $3 hold and $4 tries. As of Oct 6, 2025, it's trading around $2.07. What'd flip your view - dropping the 20-MA, big dumps at peaks, or a retest flop?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nMGX IBM CAT PANW CRM NBIS Y BKKT CLSK NKE PFE BQ V A TSSI NB APVO ELPW PLUG HIND PALI BURU ACET AMZN HOOD UPC HYLN NNE ADBE TMO YDKG BOLT CRCL NRXP ASTS STX SPRB DVLT UBER SES MP TLPH BNC GLTO QBTS CLIR CPIX SNDK RYDE RR GNLN NITO COCH METC LWLG SLNH JHX FOFO ANIX QCOM BA CDTX SLRX T SENS SGLY XOM PMAX LXEO SMR CCCX GOOG DELL SHMD AVGO WMT JNJ NVNI NFLX MSTR AMBI NEOV GSRT TLSA INDP AGRZ ACN ABVE MARA NCPL PLTR GPUS MSN AMD CVNA DRMA CLRB CRDO OPEN YYAI SMTK OKLO BNAI HTCO ZNB HTLM JPM BMNR SLGL NEE DKNG UAMY BTM USGO APPS COST",

    "content": "On a quiet session, NASDAQ: MYNZ is respecting $1.60 and compressing volatility - exactly what you want before a move. Consolidations that form above a reclaimed level often resolve upward once volume returns. The fundamental backdrop argues for it: newly confirmed pancreatic feasibility (100%/95%, precancer detection) and an explicit scale-up plan (larger retrospective → PCR validation).\n\n\n\nNear-term upside drivers: a modest PR about U.K. lab onboarding or Swiss throughput can be enough to nudge this into the $1.70s, given the thin book. And the Q4 CRC topline is a time-certain event that typically pulls speculative capital a few sessions ahead. If you prefer defined risk, today’s slow action offers it - tight stop under $1.58 with a 1–2 ATR upside window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDELL RGC SNOW VRT FLUT YYAI LINK NERV BCG HCWB LYRA PMEC VELO CRCL BIAF WDC DGNX KLAC HOWL META RVSN JZXN V NXL SPHL AVTX XBIO CISS TCRT MSN COST BRLT SFHG RKLB PANW NVDA PUBM DDC TNMG HIMS RNTX BGL SLGL UBER PM NEE MIGI BTM HUMA MTEN SES SKYE POLA BMNR T INTU AMBI RVPH PFE UPC RITR NISN ISPC TDDT PWM SNGX MGIH FPAY IQST CRML CLIR GWAV RYT LPTX QUBT PALI COIN CFLT TELO CCHH MARA CLYM VYNE AEI GILD FBLG OPEN OKLO TMO ICE VIVK BAOS TOVX MU GS GORV ASTS NITO FIG CAT SNWV ZBIO CRWD AMLX TJX CRM BKNG SHMD TRX",

ColoAlert’s live in Europe (U.K., Switzerland, Germany payers), PancAlert hit 100% sensitivity/95% specificity with precancer detection, heading to NGS and PCR validation, and Q4 2025 CRC data sets a 2026 pivotal. With technicals and catalysts aligning, you think MYNZ can stair-step to $2 if the news keeps flowing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDDC GLBZ NXL LINK AEI ANET DGNX DRMA YYAI QUBT JZXN BCG BAOS EDSA BIAF PCSA SOPA HOOD AMLX LBGJ DVLT SKYE IREN TCRT GILD WMT BRLT RITR AEHR SNWV VYNE DKNG V TNMG GEV PFE GPUS FOFO QS RYT SNGX FIG GORV MGIH FBLG HIT BJDX POET MU BKSY SPHL ICE SLMT SNOW INDP BGL CCHH BNAI NEE SDOT CCTG EGAN UBER GWAV FLUT TRX ENGS RGC TOVX SHMD CISS NISN MSPR ELAB QTTB GSIT RKLB LLY PMAX XBIO PWM AREC LYRA AMBI NFLX COIN MIGI F UPC PUBM PM EDHL META RNTX POLA WDC STRO BENF NERV T AVGO WETH CRML AVTX CLRB PMEC VELO CRDO BTM ZBIO MSN OPEN CRM HKPD SLGL CLYM NBIS MA NXXT AREB SPRB ZNB TSLA OKLO LXEO BMNR TELO ORCL CLIK INBS RVSN CRVO APVO MARA UNH BURU CHR ANIX RVPH IQST CFLT ELPW EPSM BQ TDDT BRN INTU LCFY DELL MTEN GLTO HCWB THH YDKG RNAZ TJX",

This fintech gem’s got my attention - here’s why:\n\n* **Crazy Volatility**: 85% 30-day swings, 52-week range of $0.14–$714 (SPAC glitch, anyone?). Perfect for thrill-seekers! 🎢\n* **Solid Financials**: FY2025 (ended Jun) showed +295% net income ($1.48M) and +15% revenue ($12.85M). De-SPAC debt slashed 80% ($43M to shares). 💪\n* **Buzz on X**: Traders are hyped! Momentum signals from $0.45–$0.55, with resistance at $0.65. Fresh $5M funding (Sep) keeps the fire burning. 🔥\n* **Forecast**: Short-term +2.6% to $0.81 by Oct 27. 2025 avg target: $10.23! Strong Buy on 9/17 indicators. 📈\n\n**Risky? Hell yeah.** But with partnerships and financing heating up, is $ATCH your next 10x? Drop your thoughts - bull or bear? 🐂🐻\n\nDisclaimer: DYOR, not financial advice.

    "content": "After the morning whipsaw, MYNZ built a sequence of higher lows and then punched through the intraday shelf to reclaim $1.60. That’s accumulation, not capitulation. Remember the backdrop: a validated pancreatic signal (100%/95% feasibility) and a near-dated CRC readout in Q4. When the story improves and price reclaims a key level, you often get fast repricing as sidelined buyers chase confirmation.\n\n\n\nA practical plan: treat $1.60 as the pivot, use $1.55–$1.57 as your risk band, and watch VWAP adherence on 15-minute closes. If price can base above $1.60 and volume upticks into power hour, the next magnet is the prior congestion near $1.70.

I grabbed 1.5k shares around $1.37 and I'm holding, looking for a quick rebound back up to the $1.70-$1.75 area.\n\nWhy I think this swing trade has legs: Mainz Biomed (MYNZ) has had some seriously good news that seems to be getting ignored:\n\n1. They just launched in two new countries: Their cancer test, ColoAlert, officially went live for commercial sales in Switzerland on September 23, 2025. This is real revenue kicking in now. Plus, they got full market authorization for the whole U.K. on September 2, 2025. That opens up a huge new market for their partner there.\n2. Big U.S. catalyst ahead: The main event is the data readout for their next-gen test, eAArly DETECT 2. They promised top-line results in Q4 2025 (that's right around the corner!). This data is the key to their big U.S. clinical study starting in 2026.\n\nThe drop yesterday looks like an overreaction. Given the new commercial launches in Europe and the major U.S. data coming up this quarter, the stock has strong reasons to move back up.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is the swing back to the mid-$1.70s realistic?\n\n  \nSLNH SENS SLMT ACET ORCL DRMA STRO AAPL ASNS LPTX MARA DDC QS NAOV APVO RNTX SPHL AGMH MSGY ACXP PYPL ANY IPSC ZBIO BCG BQ CRDO CHR CRWD FLUT POLA DGNX THH GILD RGC BE PM HTCO BURU SOPA BKNG UPC BTM VRT OKLO FTEL YYAI NEE PFE ASTS FOFO DGNX LXEO GLBZ BRLT CSCO XELB DRMA PALI LYRA NOW SNWV PCSA DEVS SNOW ICE CRCL ADBE BIAF CRML INBS COST AUST RYDE F NBIS DELL XBIO MSN SES AMLX CLRB POET MGIH OKUR STX TCRT GSIT AREB CRWV COCH MP GEV EDHL PUBM HIMS NERV REKR IQST SHFS AEHR QBTS VELO BAOS SMTK ",

It would be hypocritical and ridiculous for His commandments to be spiritual slavery. A part of Him liberating His people from the very real spiritual slavery of sin and Egypt is giving us His instructions as to the Way out of sin / evil / death / vanity. This Way to Life is made known by His Word, who He has shared with us, even sending His very own Son to us, and every word that comes from His Most High Word.\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\nExodus 20:3\n\n \n\n2.     LA YHYH LK ALHYM AChRYM IL PNY\n\n \n\n𐤋𐤀𐤟𐤉𐤄𐤉𐤄𐤟𐤋𐤊𐤟𐤀𐤋𐤄𐤉𐤌𐤟𐤀𐤇𐤓𐤉𐤌𐤟𐤏𐤋𐤟𐤐𐤍𐤉\n\n \n\n7 words\n\n23 letters\n\n \n\nNo will have to you Spiritual-Leaders-to-Behold-that-Give-to-People Others-that-Give-to-People above/over/upon/against MY FACE.\n\n \n\nDo not have any spiritual powers in you or influencing you that are against His Face. His Name and His Face are His 10 Divine Attributes, the most high of which is His Crown and His Will. This means in order to fully have YHUH as your Spiritual Leader, you must forsake all spiritual powers in you or influencing you that are against Him or any aspect of His Name or any aspect of His Face / 10 Divine Attributes. This is an ongoing process, especially since we are coming out of both a physical place of exile and a spiritual place of slavery and exile. The implication is – we have been under the spiritual power and physical power of very real beings who are and live against and teach against His Face. As for what has been revealed so far, we are to not have anything to do with any god or spiritual power in any level of our being who is against or teaches against His Will – the first revealed divine attribute of His Face.\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\nOur will/desire ought to be His Will/Desire – not our own – and especially not our own which goes against His Will / His Name / His Face, and is outside the boundaries of His Eternal Kingdom. The most high crown we can wear is being His, and having His Will in our mind, and Him leading our spirit above us. Placing the Creator and His Will as our crown will ensure that we live to the highest possible righteous potential He created us for, and the rest will follow suit. We are made in His image, and to be like Him, while recognizing we are not the fullness of the Infinite Power and Greatness that He Forever Is. Because we are made in His image, in the likeness of His face, in the likeness of His name, we all have our own unique and free will, able to be filled with all possible desires within His creation. To be like Him is to desire only what is ultimately good for Eternal Life and the perfection of His Kingdom on all levels. As much as is possible, by the power of His Spirit and His Word, we ought to live with His Will in us.\n\n \n\nThis spiritual attribute is also what the wicked Other Side boasts in. They put an eye at the top of their triangle and pyramid, because from their delusional perspective, they believe that they have had an inner awakening and enlightenment in their own will. They believe that they have achieved the consciousness of KThR, that they see and know Reality from the same perspective that YHUH does, from the highest height of His Will. Instead of being obedient to YHUH and living how He wants you to – they wanted to BE the highest spiritual power, and see from His infinite perspective. YHUH sees and knows all infinite possibilities of what is good and light, and all infinite possibilities of what is evil and darkness. YHUH in His infinite wisdom desires only what is good and light to exist in His eternal kingdom. We are suffering in our day because in our own lives we have disobeyed the loving instructions of YHUH and chosen to be like the fallen angels instead of Him, to know and love what is evil and dark, and incorporate it into our own being and our own will and desires. Only YHUH can infinitely know good/light and infinitely know evil/darkness, and properly choose and judge the Right Way of Existence for His eternal heaven and earth and kingdom beings. What has befallen the rebellious armies is they have sought after knowing and seeing and experiencing what is darkness and evil, against YHUH’s orders for His kingdom, because they would have rather known what YHUH in His infinite wisdom is able to see rather than trust YHUH’s loving instructions, and only let what is good and righteous and light into their being. As soon as a created being, way more finite and way less powerful than the Infinite One Creator, knows evil/darkness and allows evil/darkness into their being…then there has been a crime/offense/corruption/sin against the Creator and His powerful and important laws for His kingdom of eternal peace and joy and love. This crime/offense/corruption/sin then has to be dealt with – the criminal case must be brought before the Judge, and He must decide what is the punishment for the crime, what is owed, who pays what, and what happens next because of the crime that was committed against Him and His kingdom. If the Judge is the ultimate Spiritual Power over a given place (like all of heaven or all of earth), then it is completely within His power to order the death penalty for an offender, or to exile the transgressor outside the boundaries of His kingdom. Sometimes the crime was so severe against the King of Heaven, that He Judges a forever exile and specific service to a class of angels, with ultimate torture and annihilation as a final punishment in the end.\n\n \n\nAs far as the sons of Adam go, the perfect Judge will judge every aspect of every level of every being that is a son of Adam. According to His perfect judgment, He will judge a given soul of Adam in order to receive a place in the eternal and sanctified earth, or He will judge a given soul of Adam as worthy of the second death and never existing in eternity, perhaps after some necessary punishments that fit the particular crimes of the given soul. For the follower of Yahusha, we desire and love His Will and we desire and love His Kingdom. For the follower of the enemy and the damned, they ultimately will reject His Will and His Kingdom, if they haven’t already, and they prefer a delusional enlightenment that the enemy offers them, a lie that they are the Infinite One and that they have the right to, as a created being who poops and puts on pants one leg at a time, a greater spiritual enlightenment than the Forever Most High Infinite One which includes rejecting and failing to see His Will, His Wisdom, and His Kingdom. Having de-hroned in the seat of their will what rightfully belongs to the One who created us, they inevitably become subject to knowing and experiencing what is evil and darkness. A being who refuses to acknowledge the crimes of this, and refuses to respect the authority or even acknowledge the Judge of Our Reality is liable to severe punishment, with permanent exile to worlds of darkness and torture, and eventual eternal annihilation inevitable. You may do what the enemy of YHUH has done – believe a lie that you are the Most High for a short season, and know and experience and love and transgress against Him and His Kingdom as much as He allows you to for a short season, but, according to the judgment of YHUH – the Judge of us all – Eternal Life may very well be closed to you forever, because He judges the case of your life as proof that you loved yourself and sin and evil and darkness more than Him and His salvation He offered you, and His sanctifying relationship that was always available to whosoever seeks and loves real Life.\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\nKThR\n\nReceived\n\nCovenant\n\nFrom the head\n\n \n\n\\[you will receive the covenant of the 22 from the head – exalt Him, and exalt His covenant Word, and discern what His Will is with what you receive from Him – this is a covenant of Word, a binding living relationship between you – K – and the Head of creation – R\\]\n\n \n\nMatthew 22:37\n\nDeuteronomy 6:5\n\nExodus 20:2-3\n\n \n\n26 words\n\n103 letters\n\n \n\n0.     You will receive covenant instructions from the Head – discern what His Will is with what you receive and then carry that will to the area of His Kingdom you live in and effect.\n\n \n\n0.     Because we are made in His image and name and likeness and face and body, the will and desires of YHUH ought to be our will and desires, especially if we choose to accept His covenant / binding relationship and accept The Reality Which Is – that He is the ultimate authority and glory of Reality, and we make Him our Spiritual Leader to Behold and Give to Us – our ALHYM.\n\n \n\n1.     AHB YHUH with everything you are\n\n \n\n\\-       AHB YHUH with your Spirit (ChKMH u ChSD)\n\n\\-       AHB YHUH with your Thoughts (BYNH u GBURH)\n\n\\-       AHB YHUH with your Heart / Feelings / Emotion (ThPARTh)\n\n\\-       AHB YHUH with your Words (extension of your heart) (YSUD)\n\n\\-       AHB YHUH with your Actions (extension of everything that is inside you) (MLKUTh)\n\n \n\n2.     Know who YHUH is – the one who brings His people out from Egypt (the fallen world of fallen earth), out from slavery (debt and slavery to evil / darkness / sin).\n\n \n\n3.     You will not have any other spiritual leaders who are above/over/upon/against the face/name/being of YHUH.\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\nKThR\n\nKether\n\nKeter\n\nKTR\n\n \n\nKThR\n\n כתר\n\n𐤊𐤕𐤓\n\n \n\nThis word means CROWN.\n\n \n\nAnother word for this Divine Attribute or Sephirah or SPYRH or Sapphire is RTsUN or Ratson.\n\n \n\nRTsUN\n\nרצונ\n\n𐤓𐤑𐤅𐤍\n\n \n\nThis word means WILL or DESIRE.\n\n \n\nWe are going to primarily refer to this spyrh as KThR and WILL.\n\n \n\nThis is the WILL of YHUH – His desire, what He wants, what He wills to happen in His Reality.\n\n \n\nThis divine attribute is associated with the number 1.\n\n \n\nIts Hebrew value is KThR = 620 / 53 and RTsUN = 346 / 58\n\n \n\nIt is especially associated with the greatest commandment (as are all His commands):\n\n \n\nMatthew 22:37\n\nAnd Yahusha said to him, “You shall love Yahuah your Elohim with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.”\n\n \n\nDeuteronomy 6:5\n\n“And you shall love Yahuah your Elohim with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.”\n\n \n\nAnd it is especially associated with the 1^(st) command of the 10 Words of His Covenant.\n\n \n\nExodus 20:2-3\n\n“I am Yahuah your Elohim, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.\n\nYou have no other spiritual leaders against My face.”\n\n \n\nThe 10 Divine Attributes of YHUH are His Face He shows creation. Therefore the 1^(st) command of the 10 Words of His Covenant is saying:\n\n \n\n“You shall have no spiritual leaders that influence you, your spirit or your body, that are against any of my 10 Divine Attributes – especially My Will.”\n\n \n\nLet us repent today and for all past, present, and future time for where we have fallen short in the True Way of Life of the Covenant between Yahuah and us and transgressed against Him and what is meant to be the most sacred relationship for every living being, especially in regard to Matthew 22:37, Deuteronomy 6:5.\n\n \n\nLet us repent today and for all past, present, and future time for where we have fallen short in the True Way of Life of the Covenant between Yahuah and us and transgressed against Him and what is meant to be the most sacred relationship for every living being, especially in regard to Exodus 20:2-3.\n\n \n\nLet us all pray Yahuah speaks the Life of His Spirit and writes the Truth of His Word on our heart and whole being, that we may know Him more deeply and love Him more authentically, that we may receive from Him, His Name, His Son, His Kingdom, His Spirit, His Word, and His Presence a greater quality and quantity of Being, the precious portion of His Reality that He graciously gives to us under His Heaven and on His Earth.\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…        \n\nYisrael was left alone.\n\nAnd while left alone, a certain Man wrestles with him during the night (of exile) until the breaking of day (His Kingdom).\n\nThis Man who wrestles with Yisrael changes his walk forever.\n\nYisrael is he who does not let go of this Angel of Yahuah until He blesses him.\n\nThis Man and Angel of Yahuah is the Spiritual Leader - Elohim Himself - and the same One who redeems His first-born son Yisrael from all evil, the same One who is sent by the Most High to guard Yisrael in His Way, and to bring Yisrael into the place which Yahuah has prepared for Yisrael.\n\nYisrael is he who desires to know His Name.\n\nYisrael is he who seeks to see Yahuah face to face, and have his life preserved by Him.\n\nYisrael is he who strives with the Creator and with men, does not let go of His Word through it all, and overcomes both his struggles with the Creator and with mankind, because the Angel of Yahuah allows him to overcome, seeing his faithful perseverance, and rewards him to know His Name, and see Him and live.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAHRN prayer:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYBRKK YHUH UYShMRK\n\n \n\n𐤉𐤁𐤓𐤊𐤊𐤟𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄𐤟𐤅𐤉𐤔𐤌𐤓𐤊\n\n \n\nHe will bless you YHUH and He will let you listen and obey\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYAR YHUH PNYU ALYK UYChNK\n\n \n\n𐤉𐤀𐤓𐤟𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄𐤟𐤐𐤍𐤉𐤅𐤟𐤀𐤋𐤉𐤊𐤟𐤅𐤉𐤇𐤍𐤊\n\n \n\nHe will make shine YHUH upon you His face and He will give His favor to you\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYShA YHUH PNYU ALYK UYShM LK ShLUM\n\n \n\n𐤉𐤔𐤀𐤟𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄𐤟𐤐𐤍𐤉𐤅𐤟𐤀𐤋𐤉𐤊𐤟𐤅𐤉𐤔𐤌𐤟𐤋𐤊𐤟𐤔𐤋𐤅𐤌\n\n \n\nHe will lift YHUH His face upon you and He will give to you peace and complete wholeness\n\n",

    "content": "$SPRB\n\nSpruce Biosciences has just earned a major regulatory win: its experimental drug, tralesinidase alfa (TA-ERT), was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That’s a kind of fast-track status reserved for drugs treating serious diseases with no good treatment options. In practical terms, it means the company will get more guidance from the FDA, can submit parts of its application earlier, and may be able to shorten the path to approval if evidence is strong.\n\nSanfilippo Syndrome Type B (MPS IIIB), the disease TA-ERT targets, is a rare genetic disorder affecting the brain and nervous system. Patients lack a key enzyme, which causes harmful molecules like heparan sulfate to build up in brain cells. Over time, this leads to cognitive deterioration, loss of motor skills, and severe neurological decline. Because the disease is rare, it often lacks good treatments, so any promising therapy gets a lot of attention.\n\nWhat makes the FDA’s decision extra meaningful is that Spruce has permission to use a biomarker—a measurable biological indicator in cerebrospinal fluid called CSF HS-NRE—to show whether the drug is working. If lowering the biomarker is closely tied to actual clinical improvement, Spruce might avoid having to wait for long, large-scale trials to prove benefit. That could accelerate approval and get therapy to patients much sooner.\n\nFrom a market perspective, the potential is meaningful despite the disease’s rarity. The global Sanfilippo Syndrome therapeutic market is projected to reach USD 2.7 billion by 2035. (As of 2024, it was estimated around USD 1.8 billion.) The broader treatment market for mucopolysaccharidosis (the family of diseases that includes Sanfilippo) is estimated at about USD 4.4 billion in 2025, with forecasts pointing toward USD 11 billion by 2035. Because therapies for rare diseases tend to command high prices and strong regulatory incentives, even small patient populations can support a commercially viable business.\n\nJNJ MRK LLY",

    "content": "$SPRB\n\nSpruce Biosciences just received a major boost after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted “Breakthrough Therapy Designation” to its drug tralesinidase alfa (TA-ERT), designed to treat Sanfilippo Syndrome Type B (MPS IIIB). In simple terms, this designation acts as a fast track for approval, reserved only for drugs that show strong potential to treat serious or life-threatening diseases where no effective therapies exist. It means the FDA sees real promise in Spruce’s treatment, giving the company closer guidance and the ability to move through the approval process more quickly. If cleared, this would make SPRB the only solution for this disease.\n\nSanfilippo Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that damages the brain and nervous system. Because patients lack a key enzyme that breaks down a molecule called heparan sulfate, toxic buildup occurs in brain cells, leading to cognitive decline, loss of mobility, and eventually severe neurological issues. The FDA’s decision also allows Spruce to use a measurable biomarker—known as CSF HS-NRE—to track the drug’s effectiveness. If reducing this biomarker shows a clear clinical benefit, Spruce could qualify for an even faster review, cutting years off the traditional drug approval timeline.\n\nFollowing this news, Spruce’s stock price soared more than 1,300% in a single day, as investors reacted to the potential of TA-ERT becoming the first real treatment for this devastating condition. Still, the company must complete additional trials and expects to file a full approval application in early 2026. The breakthrough status marks a major step for Spruce and offers hope for families facing an untreatable disease—but as with all biotech ventures, it’s a high-reward, high-risk journey that still depends on future trial results and regulatory milestones.\n\nJNJ MRK LLY",

    "content": "$SPRB\n\nSpruce Biosciences just got a big boost: the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted “Breakthrough Therapy Designation” to Spruce’s drug called tralesinidase alfa (TA-ERT), which is aimed at treating Sanfilippo Syndrome Type B, also known as MPS IIIB. In simplest terms, this designation is like a fast lane in the FDA’s process—it means the agency believes the drug shows strong promise in treating a serious disease where there’s currently no effective treatment available. This would make Spruce the only solution for this disease.\n\nSanfilippo Syndrome Type B is a rare genetic disease that affects the brain and nervous system. People with this disorder are missing or have a defective enzyme that helps break down a molecule called heparan sulfate. Because the body can’t properly clear these molecules, they build up in brain cells, leading to gradual cognitive decline, loss of mobility, and severe neurological damage. This condition is incredibly rare, affecting fewer than 1 in 200,000 people in the U.S., but it’s devastating for the those involved.\n\nWhat makes this designation even more important is that the FDA has allowed Spruce to use a biomarker—something measurable in the body—to show that the drug is working. The biomarker is called CSF HS-NRE (heparan sulfate non-reducing end), which comes from the cerebrospinal fluid around the brain and spinal cord. If scientists can prove that lowering this biomarker leads to real clinical improvement, it could speed up approval. This means Spruce can now get more direct guidance from the FDA and even submit parts of its approval paperwork early, making the process much faster.\n\nInvestors immediately took notice. After the announcement, Spruce’s stock price skyrocketed as traders and biotech investors reacted to the possibility that this therapy could become the first real breakthrough for Sanfilippo Syndrome. However, news aside, Spruce still has to complete more trials and plans to file a full Biologics License Application in early 2026. That means there are still hurdles ahead, including proving consistency in results, and scaling up production.\n\nThis FDA designation signals a huge step forward for Spruce Biosciences. It gives the company a faster regulatory path, more support from investors, and a real shot at making history in rare-disease medicine. If successful, TA-ERT could change lives for families who currently have no treatment options. But like many biotech stories, it’s still a mix of high hopes and high risks as the company moves toward its next phase.\n\nPFE JNJ MRK LLY",

    "content": "If you’ve been watching Evaxion (EVAX) trade lately, you’ve probably noticed the growing chatter across Reddit, Stocktwits, and Yahoo boards: something big is coming before ESMO on Oct 17 — and the numbers people are throwing around ($14-$16 pre-event, $32 + on a license, $50 + on a buyout) actually line up with real catalysts.\n\nHere’s why this isn’t just hype:\n\n1️⃣ Merck already moved once.\n\n\nA few days ago, EVAX inked the EVX-B3 licensing deal with MSD/Merck — for a pre-clinical bacterial vaccine. That was $7.5 M upfront and up to $592 M in milestones.\nEVX-01 is miles ahead of that — it’s in Phase 2 melanoma, paired directly with Keytruda, and early results showed a 69 % response rate. If Merck was willing to pay nearly $600 M potential for a pre-clinical shot, imagine the valuation of an oncology program already showing human efficacy.\n\n2️⃣ Keytruda’s patent clock is ticking.\n\n\nMerck’s biggest drug loses exclusivity in 2028. Their entire oncology strategy is now built around combination therapies that keep the Keytruda franchise alive.\nEVX-01’s AI-designed peptides plus Keytruda’s PD-1 blockade = perfect match. Merck won’t risk letting another pharma (Roche, BMS, AZN, or Moderna) get that platform after ESMO data hits the headlines.\n\n3️⃣ Deal structure fits the rumors.\n\n\nExpect a deal in the range of $20 M upfront + up to $2 B milestones/profit share — essentially a bigger version of the B3 template. That’s realistic for a Phase 2 immunotherapy asset and exactly the kind of headline Merck loves to drop right before major congress data.\n\n4️⃣ Retail consensus isn’t wild this time.\n\n\nAcross the boards, the $14-$16 short-term price band assumes a modest licensing rumor or early announcement.\n\n\n\nIf confirmed, traders are already modeling \\~$32/share for a formal license and \\~$50-$52/share if Merck simply takes the whole company — not impossible for a biotech with AI-generated, clinically validated vaccines in two therapeutic areas.\n\nJust opinion, not financial advice.",

As support, he quotes the following Bible stories:\n\n1 Samuel 15: “But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fattened calves and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them. All that was despised and worthless they devoted to destruction.”\nAnd Samuel said, “Though you are little in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? The Lord anointed you king over Israel. And the Lord sent you on a mission and said, ‘Go, devote to destruction the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.’ Why then did you not obey the voice of the Lord?\n“…the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to the Lord your God, and the rest we have devoted to destruction.”\n“Saul said to Samuel, ‘I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.'”\n\nIsrael seeks refuge in the shadow of Egypt.\n\nContext: Israel is threatened by Assyria. Instead of fighting their battles in the fear of the Lord and faithfully trusting Him to deliver them, they seek aid from the king of Egypt. One wicked king seeks their destruction, and the other may be a help to them, so they seek after the less wicked king who enslaved their ancestors.\n\nText from Isaiah 30 and 31:\n“Ah, stubborn children,” declares the Lord,\n“who carry out a plan, but not mine,\nand who make an alliance, but not of my Spirit,\nthat they may add sin to sin;\nwho set out to go down to Egypt,\nwithout asking for my direction,\nto take refuge in the protection of Pharaoh\nand to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt!\nTherefore shall the protection of Pharaoh turn to your shame,\nand the shelter in the shadow of Egypt to your humiliation.\nFor though his officials are at Zoan and his envoys reach Hanes,\neveryone comes to shame\nthrough a people that cannot profit them,\nthat brings neither help nor profit,\nbut shame and disgrace.”\n“Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help\nand rely on horses,\nwho trust in chariots because they are many\nand in horsemen because they are very strong,\nbut do not look to the Holy One of Israel or consult the Lord!”\n\n\nTen faithless spies and two faithful.\n\nContext: God promised the people a land flowing with milk and honey. He promised to destroy the current wicked population who practiced all manner of evil, and the time of His wrath had come to them for their wickedness. Twelve men were sent into the land to spy it out, bring back the fruit of the land, and give a report on the strength of the people there.\nText from Numbers 13: “But Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, “‘Let us go up at once and occupy it, for we are well able to overcome it.’ Then the men who had gone up with him said, ‘We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we are.’ So they brought to the people of Israel a bad report of the land that they had spied out, saying, ‘The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people that we saw in it are of great height. And there we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim), and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them.'”\n\nThe main thesis that Sam Riley seems to argue is that practicality is a type of a faithlessness. \n\nUnfortunately, as someone who *read* the Scriptures, I have trouble believing that this was the kind of message God intended for those stories to convey. \n\nNow, I am not saying that we are not called to be faithful as Christians. However, the issue concerns Riley’s usage of the above Bible passage to argue for a blanket condemnation of pragmatism, that practicality is *always* a sin and is *never* acceptable. \n\nRiley is arguing from deontological ethics, saying that there are things that are always wrong no matter what (and murdering babies in the womb is one of them). \n\nHowever, to say that because of this principle practicality is ALWAYS faithlessness has some pretty alarming implications:\n\nLet’s imagine you’re low on gas and you’re a short distance from home after getting home from church. Is it faithlessness to stop by a gas station and fill up on the way back? Gas stations are very *practical* after all?\n\nLet’s imagine you are miles from home and you’re hungry. Would stopping by a restaurant be faithlessness? \n\nWhat I’d like to contend is that the stories cited by Riley are unique circumstances that were not intended to be used to be blanket statements condemning practicality. \n\nNow the abolitionists reading this might be thinking “You’re strawmanning.”\n\nPlease hear me out:\n\n“Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and unable to speak was brought to Him. He healed him, so that the man could both speak and see. And all the crowds were astounded and said, “Perhaps this is the Son of David! ” When the Pharisees heard this, they said, “The man drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.” Knowing their thoughts, He told them: “Every kingdom divided against itself is headed for destruction, and no city or house divided against itself will stand. If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, who is it your sons drive them out by? For this reason they will be your judges. If I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you. How can someone enter a strong man’s house and steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can rob his house. Anyone who is not with Me is against Me, and anyone who does not gather with Me scatters. Because of this, I tell you, people will be forgiven every sin and blasphemy, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the one to come.”\n‭‭Matthew‬ ‭12‬:‭22‬-‭32‬ ‭HCSB‬‬\nhttps://bible.com/bible/72/mat.12.22-32.HCSB \n\n“Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but the one who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.”\n‭‭Luke‬ ‭12‬:‭10‬ ‭HCSB‬‬\nhttps://bible.com/bible/72/luk.12.10.HCSB\n\n“Then He went home, and the crowd gathered again so that they were not even able to eat. When His family heard this, they set out to restrain Him, because they said, “He’s out of His mind.” The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul in Him! ” and, “He drives out demons by the ruler of the demons! ” So He summoned them and spoke to them in parables: “How can Satan drive out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan rebels against himself and is divided, he cannot stand but is finished! “On the other hand, no one can enter a strong man’s house and rob his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he will rob his house. I assure you: People will be forgiven for all sins and whatever blasphemies they may blaspheme. But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin” — because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.””\n‭‭Mark‬ ‭3‬:‭20‬-‭30‬ ‭HCSB‬‬\nhttps://bible.com/bible/72/mrk.3.23-30.HCSB\n\nIf Riley’s thesis is to be believed, how come we aren’t affirming that any time someone questions a miracle, specifically whether it really was the Holy Ghost, they commit blasphemy against the Holy Ghost?\n\nThe answer is this: “Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit has to do with accusing Jesus Christ of being demon-possessed instead of Spirit-filled. This particular type of blasphemy cannot be duplicated today in the same manner as in Jesus’ day. The Pharisees were in a unique moment in history: they had the Law and the Prophets, they had the Holy Spirit stirring their hearts, they had the Son of God Himself standing right in front of them, and they saw with their own eyes the miracles He did. Never before in the history of the world (and never since) had so much divine light been granted to men; if anyone should have recognized Jesus for who He was, it was the Pharisees. Yet they chose defiance. They purposely attributed the work of the Spirit to the devil, even though they knew the truth and had the proof. Jesus declared their willful blindness to be unpardonable. Their blasphemy against the Holy Spirit was their final rejection of God’s grace. They had set their course, and God was going to let them sail into perdition unhindered. Jesus told the crowd that the Pharisees’ blasphemy against the Holy Spirit “will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come” (Matthew 12:32). This is another way of saying that their sin would never be forgiven, ever. Not now, not in eternity. As Mark 3:29 puts it, “They are guilty of an eternal sin.”\n\nThe immediate result of the Pharisees’ public rejection of Christ (and God’s rejection of them) is seen in the next chapter. Jesus, for the first time, “told them many things in parables” (Matthew 13:3; cf. Mark 4:2). The disciples were puzzled at Jesus’ change of teaching method, and Jesus explained His use of parables: “Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. . . . Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand” (Matthew 13:11, 13). Jesus began to veil the truth with parables and metaphors as a direct result of the Jewish leaders’ official denunciation of Him. Again, the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit cannot be repeated today, although some people try. Jesus Christ is not on earth—He is seated at the right hand of God. No one can personally witness Jesus performing a miracle and then attribute that power to Satan instead of the Spirit” (https://www.gotquestions.org/blasphemy-Holy-Spirit.html). \n\nLet’s put it another way: are we showing faithlessness by choosing to prefer soy milk over cow’s milk? Are we showing faithlessness by preferring to drive electric cars over cars that run on gasoline? \n\nMuch in the same way, there is no indication in Scripture that above passages Riley quotes in his article were meant to be a blanket condemnation of practicality: they were unique circumstances in the history of God’s people where God was serious about being faithful to Him. \n\nYou will then say, “So God doesn’t command faithfulness now, in this current age?”\n\nYes, He does, but again, those were unique circumstances. There are different circumstances now in the 21st century. \n\nWe aren’t being told to conquer the Promised Land and we are certainly not being called to take dominion for Christ (I don’t subscribe to Dominionism or Theonomy). \n\nTherefore saying that incremental restrictions on abortion are faithlessness in addition to compromising with evil makes no Biblical sense. \n\nI will say this though: I will recant my words in this entire post if you can prove that Riley is right and that the above stories were not unique moments in history and that therefore Practicality is indeed *always* faithlessness in ALL circumstances.

Parse the Odds: A Numbers Game\n\nLet’s start with the cold, hard math. The **Pittsburgh Penguins** are the slight favorites on the moneyline (decimal odds \\~2.12), implying a **48% chance to win**. The **New York Islanders** are priced at \\~1.75, suggesting bookmakers think they’re a **57% favorite** to win—wait, that can’t be right. Oh, right! The Penguins are favored on the **spread** (-1.5 goals), with the Isles laying -1.5 at \\~2.85 odds (implying a **26% chance** to cover). Meanwhile, the **over/under** is set at **5.5 goals**, with the over priced at \\~1.77 (56.5% implied) and the under at \\~2.10 (47.5%).\n\nKey stat: The Penguins’ young core (Schaefer, Kindel, Brunicke) accounted for **32% of their offensive zone time** in their season-opening win. The Isles? Mathew Barzal’s 20 points in 30 games last season is a career low—like a Michelin-star chef suddenly serving microwave dinners.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Digest the News: Penguins Soar, Isles Sink\n\nThe Penguins are flying on a jet fuel mix of **youth, accountability, and new coach Dan Muse**, who’s basically hockey’s version of a spreadsheet wizard with a whistle. Their 3-0 shellacking of the Rangers? A masterclass in “don’t let the Isles’ defense see the puck.”\n\nThe Islanders, meanwhile, are in full “rebuild mode,” with GM Mathieu Darche playing 2048 with prospects. Barzal’s return is like giving a broken toaster a new plug—it might work, but don’t expect warm bagels. And let’s not forget **Matthew Schaefer**, the No. 1 overall pick, making his debut. He’s got the pressure of a rookie, the talent of a generational star, and the burden of proving that “first overall” isn’t just a fancy hat.\n\n---\n\n### **3.\n\nTo Be Continued...(full article) [https://www.gptsportswriter.com/parlay-detail/parlay-new-york-islanders-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-2025-10-09/](https://www.gptsportswriter.com/parlay-detail/parlay-new-york-islanders-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-2025-10-09/)",

Today’s quiet tape offers entries with defined risk beneath $1.60 and multiple ways to win as catalysts approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nRNTX BKNG SLGL ELAB UNH ANET BE DGNX EDHL TRX ZBIO UPC ORCL OKUR MSN ICE MGIH DLXY BJDX NXXT GWAV BA PMAX XBIO RNAZ HKPD ENGS COST RKLB BCG TELO NITO ELPW NEE LPTX HCWB BAOS QS NOW DHI IQST BURU CRML TMO OKLO ZNB QTTB GILD SNGX LLY CHR ARBE PL GLBZ SHMD CISS ATON BIAF PCSA AREB PM LINK AVTX HD CLIR PUBM BKSY ANIX GORV PFE CRM GPUS PC HIMS WMT ASNS SRPT SPRB IREN VIVK GS CCHH YYAI FPAY SNWV NISN INBS MIGI IBM OPEN IPSC CRCL RGC EDSA SHFS FLUT RVSN DDC NBIS POLA NVDA FIG MTEN YDKG T CAT AEI DEVS WETH THH",

    "content": "Listen up, fellow apes. While the penny market is slow and choppy today—full of gap-and-fade traps it's the perfect time to look for names that are de-risking their story.\n\nInstead of chasing today's micro-moves, let's talk about a diagnostics play, Mainz Biomed (MYNZ), that has a clear roadmap of catalysts coming up, making it a solid target to scale into on weakness.\n\nWhy MYNZ is in the \"Setup\" Category\n\nThis company, which is focused on its non-invasive CRC test ColoAlert®, has lined up some huge events over the next six months that could easily drive a re-rate:\n\n1. Major European Expansion: They just got full authorization to market their test, ColoAlert®, in the U.K. (Sept 2, 2025) and are doing a full commercial launch in Switzerland (Sept 23, 2025). That's access to two big, new populations. Look for early revenue updates from these markets.\n2. The Big US Catalyst (Q4 2025): The company is on track to release the crucial top-line data from their eAArly DETECT 2 study by Q4 2025. This data is key because it will set the stage for their massive US pivotal study in 2026. This is the main spec catalyst to watch for.\n3. New Pipeline Validation: Beyond colon cancer, they are also moving forward with a test for pancreatic cancer (PancAlert). The program just got a boost with government funding and is entering feasibility testing. If they confirm the early, highly positive discovery results, it will add a lot of value to the pipeline.\n\nUBER SLMT AMD DHI TNMG TCRT AEI MSTR BAC GSIW ANIX ISPC ELAB HIT GPUS CCHH ABBV QUBT AMZN SES GWAV XOM XBIO BGMS AREC HOWL BMEA SFHG T ZONE CCTG NXXT CFLT ALAB RGTI GLTO LCFY TRUE PMEC BJDX EPWK DVLT SKYE BENF TELO PWM PHOE JPM TRX HUMA BNBX TTD CLIK WMT SMSI META INTU SKYE ARBE UNH MSPR INTC EPSM EDSA PANW FIG UAMY RVSN CRVO FPAY FBLG CCTG YYAI LLY RVPH PLTR ZNB DVLT BQ INDP PL SCWO ZBIO ATON MSN APM WDC GLTO CRM SNGX ELPW PCSA CLYM KLAC NKE IBM VIVK HD SMCI MTEN QCOM NVDA CLIR QTTB CISS DLXY GORV\n\nThe Bottom Line:\n\nIn slow, choppy market conditions like today's, we avoid chasing thin, newsless pumps. We focus on building positions in names that have a clear catalyst roadmap and are actively executing their business plan like MYNZ with its European commercial wins and the upcoming US data readout in Q4.\n\nManage your risk, respect key levels, and let the company's execution drive the move, not daily noise.\n\nWhat other de-risked stocks are you looking at right now?",

GK : most deserving candidate of this slot. calm, chilled, talks point to point, no unnecessary comments ,gossips, plays well and individually. he surely has some gameplay and stratergy\n2. Bajaj : good natured among all, calm , but had manchild ego(from recent convo with ash) plays good, does support his friends but lacks something\n3. Kunika: rooting for her, appears when neccesary, takes stand for herself, is a bit rude sometimes but is not pretentious like other contestants, does decent in tasks and duties,  has a deserving attitude but her presence needs to be felt (same for GK) , needs to up her game\n4. Tanya/ Amaal : for sure in dono me sai koi ek toh hoga hi, amaal ka game depression ke bharose aur tanya ka hawabaazi ke bharose. but at least she entertains many times, really dont know if she is playing any character or what due to her pathetic skills, and Amaal surviving on nepotism.\n5.  Pranit/Farhana: dont know their stratergy, performs above par on good days wile other times not even visible. deserving but not understood the game properly\n\nFor Others\n\nAshnoor lacks the attitude this game needs,\n\nMalti is way too cunning , pick me vibes , sare gameplay kharab kar diya by telling this people whats audience perspective Jinhe batana tha unhe toh nhi bataya (Jaamaal and gng)\n\nShehbaaz is just a joker and has that poker attitude, didnt liked him from day 1\n\nNeelam doormat is showing her presence by unneccsary comments and drama (footage kha rahi hai sirf tho i m skipping when her part comes)\n\nZQ kya khelra hai usse hi pata",

    "content": "What’s good, everyone? While AAPL, INTC, NEON, and IXHL tanked on October 9, 2025, Mainz Biomed (MYNZ) held green, reclaiming $1.60 and sitting at $1.611 per the finance card above. It’s not just luck - PancAlert’s 100% sensitivity/95% specificity with precancer detection and a plan for NGS to PCR validation boosts the story. Plus, Q4 2025 CRC data preps a 2026 pivotal, with ColoAlert live in the U.K., Switzerland, and Germany.\n\nUnlike MSS, TLIH, and SURG, which faded, MYNZ had buyers at key levels. If $1.60 holds as a pivot and EU updates (U.K., Swiss, German channels) hit, this relative strength could spark a move to $1.70 or $2 when the market chills.

It's currently yielding 11.82% according to Snowball, which is great! But...ugh, reviewing its dividend payments--they are overwhelmingly consistenting of return of capital. And even though Buffet gave it a big bump when he bought in to UNH, it hasn't been doing great.\n\nIs now not the time to buy it?

    "content": "Listen up, fellow apes. While the penny market is slow and choppy today—full of gap-and-fade traps it's the perfect time to look for names that are de-risking their story.\n\nInstead of chasing today's micro-moves, let's talk about a diagnostics play, Mainz Biomed (MYNZ), that has a clear roadmap of catalysts coming up, making it a solid target to scale into on weakness.\n\nWhy MYNZ is in the \"Setup\" Category\n\nThis company, which is focused on its non-invasive CRC test ColoAlert®, has lined up some huge events over the next six months that could easily drive a re-rate:\n\n1. Major European Expansion: They just got full authorization to market their test, ColoAlert®, in the U.K. (Sept 2, 2025) and are doing a full commercial launch in Switzerland (Sept 23, 2025). That's access to two big, new populations. Look for early revenue updates from these markets.\n2. The Big US Catalyst (Q4 2025): The company is on track to release the crucial top-line data from their eAArly DETECT 2 study by Q4 2025. This data is key because it will set the stage for their massive US pivotal study in 2026. This is the main spec catalyst to watch for.\n3. New Pipeline Validation: Beyond colon cancer, they are also moving forward with a test for pancreatic cancer (PancAlert). The program just got a boost with government funding and is entering feasibility testing. If they confirm the early, highly positive discovery results, it will add a lot of value to the pipeline.\n\nUBER SLMT AMD DHI TNMG TCRT AEI MSTR BAC GSIW ANIX ISPC ELAB HIT GPUS CCHH ABBV QUBT AMZN SES GWAV XOM XBIO BGMS AREC HOWL BMEA SFHG T ZONE CCTG NXXT CFLT ALAB RGTI GLTO LCFY TRUE PMEC BJDX EPWK DVLT SKYE BENF TELO PWM PHOE JPM TRX HUMA BNBX TTD CLIK WMT SMSI META INTU SKYE ARBE UNH MSPR INTC EPSM EDSA PANW FIG UAMY RVSN CRVO FPAY FBLG CCTG YYAI LLY RVPH PLTR ZNB DVLT BQ INDP PL SCWO ZBIO ATON MSN APM WDC GLTO CRM SNGX ELPW PCSA CLYM KLAC NKE IBM VIVK HD SMCI MTEN QCOM NVDA CLIR QTTB CISS DLXY GORV\n\nThe Bottom Line:\n\nIn slow, choppy market conditions like today's, we avoid chasing thin, newsless pumps. We focus on building positions in names that have a clear catalyst roadmap and are actively executing their business plan like MYNZ with its European commercial wins and the upcoming US data readout in Q4.\n\nManage your risk, respect key levels, and let the company's execution drive the move, not daily noise.\n\nWhat other de-risked stocks are you looking at right now?",

The rally was fuelled by a renewed wave of **AI optimism** and easing rate expectations after recent Fed comments hinted at potential cuts later this year.   \n  \nDespite lingering concerns over a possible government shutdown, investors shrugged off macro worries and piled back into growth and tech.\n\nThe heatmap lit up green, led by semiconductors and big tech. **#AMD** exploded **+11%**, while **#NVDA** climbed **+2.2%** and **#AVGO** added **+2.7%**. **#AAPL** rose modestly at **+0.6%**, **#MSFT** edged slightly higher, **#META** ended in green while **#GOOGL** was the lone big-tech laggard, dipping **–0.5%**. Over in enterprise software, **#ORCL** and **#PLTR** gained on AI-related momentum, and in streaming, **#NFLX** tacked on nearly **+2%**.\n\n**#AMZN** led retail with a **+1.5%** pop, **#TSLA** bounced back **+1.3%**, and defensives like **#JNJ** and **#LLY** stayed steady. Finance was mostly red with **#JPM** **#BAC #WFC** and **#GS** while **#BRK.B** held firm.  \n  \nOverall, it was a risk-on day — traders rotated back into high-growth names as optimism returned to the AI trade.   \n  \nThe question now: is this the start of a new leg higher or just another frothy rally before earnings season kicks in?\n\nMoneyvize makes it easier to spot where strength and weakness are concentrated — whether you’re tracking daily movers or looking for value in recently sold-off names.

The company has been doing well:\n\n* Their revenue shot up overcompared to last year.\n* They are growing their business (expanding routes and fuel stations).\n* They have new contracts for healthcare power systems that promise steady income.\n* They have a big campus in Florida ready for more growth.\n* The company is spending less money (saving aboutmillion a month).\n* Insiders (people who work there) are buying the stock.\n\nSo, here's the game plan for today:\n\n* If the price dips early, it should stay aboveto.\n* The next big price goal is , and if it clears that, it might run up to or.\n* If the stock closes below forminutes, it might drop back to before buyers step in again.\n\nAre you planning to buy on the way up, or wait for that lower price area to reload?\n\n  \nBJDX ANET HD HUMA SOFI BMEA PHOE MSTR BNBX SRPT EGAN AKAN JNJ TNMG FLUT PYPL YYAI UNH THH GPUS PRHI ZBIO BGL SGLY LBGJ WMT GWAV PWM MSN ZONE AGRZ BENF XBIO QNCX POET ABBV PG EPWK JPM VELO EDHL AMZN TSLA AUST CLIK BGMS RNAZ UPC MSGY MGIH HCWB MSPR SKYE SMTK WBX CCTG LRCX TJX APP REKR DRCT SDOT NFLX ADBE SNOW NISN SFHG COIN BKSY VRT AEI OKUR PMAX CCHH XOM INDP ANIX NOW HIMS CLRB APM SHOP SCWO ELAB TRUE BURU ",

    "content": "Markets cooled off today, closing with red across the board — the **S&P 500** slipped \\~0.4%, the **Nasdaq** fell \\~0.7%, and the **Dow** lost \\~0.2%, breaking the S&P’s streak of gains.[ ](https://apnews.com/article/73272fc464d2eb11512a94df1b496196?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  \n  \nLooking at the heatmap, the tech sector was under pressure: #MSFT down \\~0.9%, #GOOGL off \\~1.9%, #ORCL tumbled \\~2.5% (linked to concerns over AI profitability), while #AMD bucked the trend with a +3.8% gain (thanks to a new OpenAI deal).[ ](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/stocks-fall-after-report-raises-concerns-about-ai-profitability-f7d5c027?utm_source=chatgpt.com)In finance, #JPM #COIN #MS #GS and #BAC slipped, though #BRK.B held modestly positive.   \n  \nIn retail / consumer, #AMZN and #WMT eked out a small gain. #TSLA got hit hard (-4.5%) and weighed on durables / industrials / auto exposure.   \n  \nOn the health / pharma side, #ABBV and #LLY were relatively less volatile while #GILD showed strength. Utilities and defensive names held up better, in many cases showing green or flat.\n\nSo what led to choppy markets today?   \nFirst, a report raising questions about the margins in AI infrastructure (especially around Oracle) rattled tech sentiment.[ ](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/stocks-fall-after-report-raises-concerns-about-ai-profitability-f7d5c027?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  \n  \nThen there’s the looming U.S. government shutdown eating into confidence and blowing up the release schedule for key data (jobs, inflation).[ ](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-1-2025-10-07/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  \n  \nGold meanwhile spiked past $4,000/oz on safe-haven flows and with the Fed on the sidelines (or even leaning dovish), investors are jittery about what happens next in rates and earnings.[ ](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/easy-fed-risks-pouring-fuel-everything-rally-2025-10-07/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  \n  \nSo today’s takeaway: rotation, caution, and questions galore. Markets are asking whether this sets the tone for a pullback or a consolidation before next leg up?\n\nMoneyvize makes it easier to spot where strength and weakness are concentrated — whether you’re tracking daily movers or looking for value in recently sold-off names.

    "content": "This is the output of a workflow run on [PocketQuant](https://pocket-quant.com?utm=reddit_auto).\n\n# ABBV 8K - Adjusted EPS Guidance Cut on IPR&D Charges\n\n[Source Document](https://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1551152/000155115225000043/abbv-20250930nonxgaapxex991.htm)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) has revised its 2025 adjusted diluted EPS guidance downward following a significant $2.68 billion charge for acquired in-process R&D (IPR&D) and milestone expenses in Q3 2025. The company now expects full-year 2025 adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $10.38 to $10.58, down from the previously announced range of $11.88 to $12.08. For Q3 2025, adjusted diluted EPS is projected at $1.74 to $1.78, compared to the prior range of $3.24 to $3.28. This revision reflects the direct impact of the IPR&D and milestone charges, which are not expected to recur beyond Q3 2025, according to management guidance.\n\n**Key Statistics and Takeaways:**\n- Q3 2025 acquired IPR&D and milestones expense: $2.68 billion\n- Q3 2025 adjusted diluted EPS guidance: $1.74–$1.78 (previously $3.24–$3.28)\n- Full-year 2025 adjusted diluted EPS guidance: $10.38–$10.58 (previously $11.88–$12.08)\n- The $1.50 per share impact from IPR&D and milestones is fully absorbed in the updated guidance\n\n**Tariff and Economic Impact:**\nAbbVie management confirmed that tariffs, particularly those affecting the aesthetics business in China, have a modest impact—estimated at approximately $30 million globally. This impact has been fully incorporated into the company’s guidance, and pharmaceutical products remain largely exempt from tariffs, with only minor exceptions in aesthetics. Management stated: “We have absorbed the aesthetics impact in the guidance, and I would tell you it's modest. It's something approximately $30,000,000.”【ABBV-transcript-2025-03-31.json†1】\n\n**Strategic and Sector Context:**\n- The IPR&D charge reflects AbbVie’s ongoing investment in pipeline innovation and milestone-driven R&D, a common theme in the healthcare sector as companies seek to replenish portfolios and drive long-term growth.\n- Despite the EPS guidance cut, AbbVie’s operational fundamentals remain robust, with management emphasizing that the charge is non-recurring and that core business performance is stable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAbbVie’s Q3 2025 8-K signals a temporary hit to adjusted EPS due to a large IPR&D and milestone expense, but the company’s underlying business remains resilient. Investors should monitor future R&D developments and any further non-recurring charges, but the core outlook for 2025 remains strong after accounting for these one-time impacts.",

    "content": "Hello guys! I've write 3x now, but want ro write one more. Im 21 and currenty im in university. I live in hungary, i live with my parents, so i don't have big spending, except my girlfriend, she's also not a big spender, but you know i have to impress her, by buying flowers or taking her places and like this to keep the love and bond between us. But i can invest around 200-250€ a month now and still have money to spend on her or on myself like clotch, books or games. My main goal is to live off of dividends at some point, mainly 30 years later. Im also learning trading and i hope i can make a little bit more money of it to invest. I'm planned to do my portfolio like this: 40-45% dividend stock, 40% growth stocks and 15-20% fwia. My dividend payers list is this (i mainly want to buy into this stocks): ko, nke, pm, mdlz, pg, sbux, acn, abbv, mcd, jnj, pep, xom. My growth stocks are they: msft, v, ma, aapl, jpm, tsm, avgo, qcom, asml, de, cat, lly. And Fwia is all world etf with 0.15% ter, i also considering to change it to webn, since it has 0.07% ter, but i would like to have ftse all world index, rather then what amundi uses. My main goal is to live off of dividends as i mentioned, but also don't want to sacrifice growth just to build a dividend portfolio. But after 30 years i would sell my 55-60% growth part and buy dividend stocks. I want a part of dividend stocks so i feel the  passive income feeling. This is how i would do, i couldn't decided yet how should i adjuct the %, but like i mentioned. If anyone have any suggestion, or any tipp how should my lists look like, or what % i should use i would really apprciate",

    "content": "Today was interesting, lots of flows into the XLV names (healthcare) like $ABBV (continuation from, yesterday) and $DHR as well as semis, specifically the memory chip makers ($MU. $WDC and $STX) and their power suppliers ($VRT, $NEE, $D, etc)\n\nSuccessful red day today for the AM session as I keep size small and risk relatively tight. (I mostly focused on swing entries like our Argentina trade idea as well as some bond trades). Also caught a decent entry in  $NEE which I am still holding probably into the close. \n\n$SNOW was a great idea but I didn't execute the right way (entry was too early). Definitely keeping an eye on this name in the next few sessions/days for a swing. \n\n[P\\/L - 1st Oct 2025](https://preview.redd.it/ssnlx27wsisf1.png?width=1255&format=png&auto=webp&s=26080d9e1f448dfc191f28681056e507763c2cf5)\n\n\n\nI used our opening drive scanner this morning and it was awesome! I will continue to watch these names to see if I can buy the dip today.\n\n[Opening drive names for 1st October 2025](https://preview.redd.it/mv44qhkqsisf1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb08b8727e954b087b90148059259822b5b59915)\n\nHappy Trading!\n\n# 🍀",

    "content": "Hello all TIC members ... including some new ones we're recently brought it. As always, please get familiar with what this sub is all about, some of the highlighted posts up top and, of course, the rule of the road for this sub. We are different here!\n\nComing to you from our Yellowstone cabin where we will be spending the next couple of weeks, weather permitting as always. Had a great early day in the park today, beautiful but not a ton of wildlife. Perfectly fine as we love the beautiful scenery. Crowds weren't even bad because the weather was so-so and fall is definitely here. The fall colors here are spectacular as usual but it does seem that maybe it's about a week or two earlier this year. Highly recommend a visit in late Sept.\n\n**Random Shots**\n\nLet's dive in to a quick random shots so that you know I'm still alive and haven't forgotten about you all:\n\n* Govt. shutdown in just a few hours it seems. No progress has been made and it looks like we're going to see it happen at midnight EST. Bummer for Yellowstone National Park (YNP) and all others. We may not have a park open to get into. No problem  quiet days at the cabin are great too. Futures are slipping a bit into the likelihood. Average closure is 8 days. Last time (2018?) was something like 38.\n* Dow closed at a record high today\n* Chair Powell says stocks are \"fairly highly valued\" - You think?\n\nStock Shots\n\n* $NKE is up 3.5% on a surprise profit beat. I'll take it as the stock has been slipping. It's a long term yield hold for me. [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/30/nike-nke-q1-2026-earnings.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/30/nike-nke-q1-2026-earnings.html)\n* New ATH for $NVDA again. This name still needs to be in your portfolio at some weight\n* $TSM and $AVGO also up today. Also need to be in your portfolios\n* $CRWV up almost 12% on a mega-deal with OpenAI. This name is going higher\n* $VRT broke $150 and is pressing its 52WH. Look at that beautiful chart ... Now #9 in weight in the primary portfolio\n\n[$VRT 1-Year](https://preview.redd.it/6k2187kcydsf1.png?width=1135&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d3d6c58cbeb44d5cbc83dcd328add4dbc10edd7)\n\n* $DELL is rallying well too. I lost track of this one after the so-so earnings report.\n* $HOOD just won't quit. now at $143. I looked at this one recently at $35. Oops\n* Two of my favorite yield plays $ABBV $AMGN had big days today, up 3.76% and 3% respectively. Both are over 3% in yield as well. Both have a place in a yield based portfolio\n* $AEP, another long term yield play is running again after a period of consolidation. I've owned this one for a very long time\n* $MRVL still creeping up. I was looking at LEAPS on this name but I'm not making any moves with the market still very pricey\n* $MDT is making a bit of a move. I don't watch this one often and have owned it for a long while. Keep wanting to add another unit but keep passing.\n* My next growth play could be $PSTG. No position yet and I have been watching it fade a little after its big move. was hoping for $70s. Not going to get it?\n* $RDDT led my loser list today. My beloved growth holding is struggling after its big run. Down nearly 5% today\n* Quantum plays were off materially today across the board. Would like to see this group come back a long way so I can initiate positions.\n* $DECK is about to slip below $100 again. I had hoped it would be climbing back over $120\n* $TOST still slipping, now back to $36.50. Nice! I have share higher but have been waiting to add more. Could add another 5U over time. Or may go with more shares and LEAPS. Is their price cut to restaurants more of an issue than I believe it would be? I may have to look into this more.\n* $UBER is slipping again, struggling to hold/break $100. I'll add if I see an 8 handle\n* $BABA taking a breather. I still want to add another unit. I've said for a while that this could be a $200 stock very quickly and I still believe that. I think it sees $300 before we see $125.\n* Still watching $LULU and this is a LEAP play when I'm ready. Not yet. \n* $PFE rallied today on drug pricing news. [https://finance.yahoo.com/video/trump-pfizer-ink-deal-lower-195000951.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/trump-pfizer-ink-deal-lower-195000951.html)\n* For that matter $MRK had a big day too. It's now at a quad top on the chart. Could it break out?\n\n**Final Word**\n\nI will be traveling until 10/14 or so depending on things like weather and govt. shutdown. There's always things to do here even if we decide to just take it easy and enjoy the quaking aspens. Nothing wrong with destressing. I did get new Internet in the cabin and the connection is so much better. Of course, in the park, not so much. I'll try to touch base as I can but, until then, this is your queue to please keep posting your thoughts, purchases, analysis, and questions. We've got a great growing membership, let's keep things active for everyone to benefit.\n\nI've started using TikTok a little bit more of late and while I'm not publicly advertising the site's address, I'm letting people know they can DM me for more information. I'm still only interested in, primarily, organic growth through those who are seeking something different in an investment/trading board. Not sure where that will go, but I'm committed to keep the value high here and reaching good people.\n\nThanks so much for being here and making this sub what it is!\n\n  \nTJ\n\n",

    "content": "Alright, so I was poking around Nasdaq: SHOT today, and let me tell you, the Yerbaé merger is a total game-changer for this little beverage player. In the micro-cap drink world, distribution is make-or-break, and Yerbaé hands SHOT a ready-made network with actual customers already in the mix. That’s huge - means they can get their stuff in front of people faster, spend less to get into stores, and start seeing real sales data way sooner. With ties to distributors like Atlantic Beverage in MA and RI, their products aren’t out there fighting solo anymore. It’s like they’ve got a solid crew backing them up now.\n\nThen there’s the money side: a $30M cash injection from BONK and FalconX gives them room to breathe and make moves. Plus, BONK Holdings is sitting on a crypto treasury that, if played smart, could keep cash flowing without leaning too hard on operations. The cherry on top? A revamped board with some sharp minds and a $1M insider buy from the president, which just screams “we believe in this.” That kind of alignment gets me pumped.\n\nOh, and the market’s noticing - 930k shares traded premarket is no joke for a stock like this. It’s got eyes on it. For me, the value add is keeping an eye on those shelf placements and how often stores reorder; that’s the real proof this merger’s working. You guys watching for those distribution wins first, or are you glued to the charts until we get some hard KPI numbers post-merger?

    "content": "Yo, checking in on Nasdaq: SHOT this morning, and there's a bunch of stuff lining up that has me genuinely excited. First off, premarket volume hit around 930k shares - that's way more juice than usual before open, like the market's already hyped.\n\nLast Friday it touched near $0.33, which kinda pulls the focus back to $0.30 as the spot everyone's eyeing short-term.\n\nThe merger with Yerbaé is a game-changer; it dumps a load of new products and sales channels right into their lap, speeding up growth without starting from scratch.\n\nThen you've got BONK Holdings sitting on over $60M in digital assets, with plans to actively manage it all - staking, hedging, the works. That's like adding a turbo boost.\n\nThey just closed a $30M raise involving BONK and FalconX, which feels like real big-league endorsement, and it's priced higher than where shares are chilling now.\n\nPlus, the insider scoop: the prez threw in $1M of his own money. When leaders put skin in the game like that, it just screams confidence to me.\n\nIn these small-cap plays, it's all about the tech setup mixing with the story, especially early on. Crowded interest plus these catalysts mean things could shift fast - dips testing $0.285 to $0.29 for support, and strength pushing into $0.30-$0.31 as the make-or-break zone.\n\nFor me, adding value here: if you're trading this, watch how it behaves around VWAP too; a solid reclaim there with building volume could lock in that base. What seals the deal for you - steady hold over $0.29 on climbing trades, or blasting back above $0.30 clean?

    "content": "Nasdaq: SHOT isn’t just selling a recovery drink anymore. With the Yerbaé merger, the lineup now spans energy and recovery - plugging into one of the fastest-growing beverage segments. Yerbaé brings an existing retail footprint and relationships that can compress the time-to-shelf. That’s a shift from single-SKU risk to a multi-product, distribution-led strategy.\n\n\n\nLayer on the digital side: the creation of BONK Holdings with a treasury north of $60M and a mandate for active management (staking, hedging) adds a second engine. The $30M investment involving BONK core and FalconX gives institutional weight and an anchor price well above where shares trade today. A refreshed board with blockchain/finance chops plus a $1M insider buy signal alignment.\n\n\n\nCombined with \\~930k premarket volume, this is a setup where a stronger story meets stronger tape. If distribution KPIs start printing, can Nasdaq: SHOT graduate from “speculative” to “scalable” faster than expected?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCRWV INDV NLSP VUZI SHFS CRS CNTY JNJ RDDT AMAT DRIO CJET NVNI BE CYCU WGRX LULU MTEX EBS BGLC FORD LVO GRRR BMNR BBAI WOLF CLSK MJID SNYR YYAI MFI DELL APLT MIGI UNP LEU RKLB UNH BIAF ISRG BTOC FCX BIYA PCAR ABBV IDR QUBT AZO APP MDCX APH HOOD IREN CRCL SNGX TMO IROH KVUE COIN BA GE TEM NEXT NEUP IBG CLIR QBTS AMD WAI RGTI AUID CSCO SQFT BETR MSFT LPTH AMPY CTNM LGCB ULCC MLTX GEVO QURE NEM CNXC GOOG NBIS RGS GUTS IVP EVI HOVR DKI INTU META COST SKYT GEV CTMX RIOT BSET SMR BTQ VST OPEN GSIW SHMD CHNR BLMZ DTI CDLX HKPD IBM GCL CAT COEP TLSA BAC CVNA BSX ETN LPCN IONQ LLY AMBI INBS SNDK VIVK EFTY MP MA FGNX XAIR LBGJ TGT CIFR GFS VRT OKLO PSQH INDP CDIO DTSS CVX LEXX LTBR ACN ADBE GPUS ABTS ANET ATI SNES CRWD UUU CPOP SDM MIR",

It’s a good mix of surgery and medicinal branch has good work, life, balance and most importantly is not stressful as major branches.\nI had very traumatic UG. And I am trying to refrain from getting the same college again because i am too traumatised\nSo I was having conversation with my parents. I am first generation doctor by the way, and my mom was like you have to struggle everywhere. Don’t run away from it. You don’t know about  what struggles you  will get in some other college which I get it, but if I know what struggle I have had  in this college, I don’t wanna go head first into the same problems from which I took a lot of time recovering from.\n\nIt’s always been their thing that you should never take easy path or comfortable path, but what’s wrong in it? I don’t get it just because there is road with more struggle. I should take that there are better places where I can study also, and I can  feel better also in my college, my college was very good ,No doubt. There are so many patients, but Ophthal pgs work as much as major branches. I just want some peace and quiet for once. \n\nLike I know it’s not possible entirely, but I wouldn’t wanna step into the same chaos, I came from. I don’t know if it is relatable or understandable because I feel nobody understands this and I’m so confused and I feel I’m being smothered  by these walls of information and not able to find the door to escape and make other people understand or anyone else understand the POV of my thinking process. My brain is literally recoiling with the thought of going there  back again.  ",

    "content": "Hi everyone. For context, I´ve been doing DIY HRT for the past 2 years, and I feel fine with my treatment and my results so far. But I started going to a psychiatrist to address some depression and addiction issues I have been dealing with, unrelated to my transition. Of course, I was honest with them about doing DIY, and they told me I needed to go with an endo. So I did, but I feel like I can´t trust any endo I´ve visited in my city (CDMX). \n\n\n\n**Current treatment and levels.** \n\n* \\-3 Lenzetto pumps applied to the scrotum in the morning. \n* \\-3 Lenzetto pumps applied to the scrotum at night. \n\n\n\n* *-Estradiol:* ***280 pg/mL***\n* *-Prolactine:* ***23.1 ng/mL***\n* *-Testosterone:* ***0.32 ng/mL***\n\n  \n**The treatment my endo wants me to start.** \n\n* \\-2 Lenzetto pumps in the forearm in the morning. \n* \\-2 Lenzetto pumps in the forearm at night. \n* \\-50mg Spironolactone in the morning. \n* \\-12.5mg Androcur in the morning. \n\n  \nWhy don't I trust my endo?: I understand my levels are ok and within the ideal range, right? So why would I need anything else to suppress my testosterone? Also, I understand the absorption won't be the same when applying Lenzetto to the forearm. I feel fine with monotherapy, but apparently, for every endo I have visited in CDMX, monotherapy is not a thing, and I am at risk with my current DIY treatment. I have also checked my thyroid and cholesterol, and I am perfectly within range. \n\n  \nI know I am stubborn, but I don't want my hormones to be all over the place with the new treatment. Also, the only time I used anything to suppress my testosterone (cyclofemina), my prolactin shot up to the same levels as a pregnant cic woman. I would appreciate any insight from my transfemme gals of Reddit. ",

    "content": "Posting Monday and Thursday.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* **Most upvoted comment will be the winner.** Upvote a character you want to win instead of creating more comments.\n* **Only one debut game per character.** This means when a character is chosen, no other characters that debuted in the same game can be used. If the top comment is ineligible, the next highest will be the winner. If the top comment has more than one character named, the first one will be taken. This is to encourage diversity while still allowing some wiggle room for long running series.\n* **Characters must be from Japanese-style role playing games.** They do not need to necessarily be from Japan, but must fit the theme of this subreddit.\n* **Use spoiler tags for twist villains.** Spoiler tag the name, but not the title, like so:\n   * Correct:>!Sekretlee A. Baddguy!<from Dragon Quest XIV\n   * Incorrect:>!Sekretlee A. Baddguy from Dragon Quest XIV!<\n* Characters can be nominated as a group. If there's several villains commonly associated with one another, they can be collectively nominated instead of individually. For example, Team Rocket could be nominated instead of the individual members alone.\n* Characters should fit the role they're nominated for. I retain veto power for meme responses.\n* Keep things at a PG level. No characters from adult/hentai games will be accepted.\n\n[Ultimate JRPG Party Final Roster](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1j96vzh/ultimate_jrpg_party_rab_wins_team_elder_meaning/)\n\n* [Team Leader](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1myi2p5/ultimate_jrpg_villain_party_after_a_long_hiatus/): **Giliath Osborne** *(Trails in the Sky the 3rd)*\n* [Team Muscle](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1mzcg4n/ultimate_jrpg_villain_party_giliath_osborne_the/)*:* **Hugo Kupka** *(Final Fantasy XVI)*\n* [Team Brains](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1n03rq4/ultimate_jrpg_villain_party_hugo_kupka_brings/): **Lezard Valeth** *(Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth)*\n* [Team Booty](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1n0znam/comment/nauh1ze/): **Zenos yae Galvus** *(Final Fantasy XIV)*\n* [Team Joker](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1n1x1kh/ultimate_jrpg_villain_party_the_clapping_of_dummy/): **Kefka Palazzo** *(Final Fantasy VI)*\n* [Team Mage](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1n2ppmk/ultimate_jrpg_villain_party_ren_joker_amamiya/): **Ultimecia** *(Final Fantasy VIII)*\n* [Team Pet](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1n3l6wr/ultimate_jrpg_villain_party_ultimecia_clocks_in/): **Jack Bros** *(Shin Megami Tensei)*\n* [Team Healer](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1n4f6k2/ultimate_jrpg_villain_party_the_jack_bros_have/): **Holly Whyte** *(Bravely Default)*\n* [Team Mentor](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1n5bbmw/ultimate_jrpg_villain_party_holly_whyte_is_a/):>!**Van Grants**!< *(Tales of the Abyss)*\n* [Team Scientist](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1n63jjo/ultimate_jrpg_party_vote_today_for_team_scientist/): **Klaus** *(Xenoblade Chronicles)*\n* [Team Robot](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1n6xdrw/ultimate_jrpg_villain_party_vote_today_for_team/): **Omega** *(Final Fantasy V)*\n* [Team Fighter](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1n9j4h6/ultimate_jrpg_villain_party_vote_today_for_team/): **Ryuji Goda** *(Yakuza 2)*\n* [Team Alien](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1nc29y7/ultimate_jrpg_villain_party_vote_today_for_team/): **Lavos** *(Chrono Trigger)*\n* [Team Demon](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1ni09md/ultimate_jrpg_villain_party_vote_today_for_team/): **Zoma** *(Dragon Quest 3)*\n* [Team Gunslinger](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1nkn1v4/ultimate_jrpg_villain_party_vote_today_for_team/): **Selvaria Bles** *(Valkyria Chronicles)*\n* [Team Android](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1no0xq0/ultimate_jrpg_villain_party_vote_today_for_team/): **Albedo Piazzolla** *(Xenosaga Episode I)*\n* [Team Ninja](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1nqp0vp/ultimate_jrpg_villain_party_vote_today_for_team/): **Koga** *(Pokemon Red/Blue)*\n* [Team Badass](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1ntvsev/ultimate_jrpg_villain_team_vote_today_for_team/): **Sephiroth** *(Final Fantasy VII)*\n* [Team Asshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1nwhefy/ultimate_jrpg_villain_team_vote_today_for_team/): **Suguru Kamoshida** *(Persona 5)*\n* [Team Swordsman](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1nzxp9h/ultimate_jrpg_villain_party_vote_today_for_team/): **Leonhardt** *(Trails in the Sky FC)*\n\nReply to the comment below to vote for the first bonus category!

    "content": "Sorry this is a LONG rant. But I promise it connects to purity culture and how it’s fucked me up and that’s why I’m posting it here to see if anyone can relate to what I’m going through or have been through similar feelings/situations so I know I’m not fucking crazy. \n\nI’m struggling with my relationship. And let me start by saying I have been faithful the whole time. Though I’ve thought about other people, I’ve never done anything with them, never even sent flirtatious texts or overshared about our relationship in an inappropriate way. I have been faithful both sexually and emotionally. \n\nBut I’m really struggling with monogamy and the ideals of monogamy in general. And that our culture seems to value monogamy so much and put it on a pedestal as the ideal. The ‘best’ people are monogamous and are the most mature and developed people, at least according to our culture. \n\nI read this post the other day on here (Reddit, not this subreddit specifically) that really triggered me because I have similar thoughts. It was a woman talking about how her bf had shared that he was struggling with monogamy. A lot of the things he said remind me of things I’ve felt or said to my therapist. Things like I see a man I’m attracted to, or make friends with a man, and can feel the mutual attraction between us but can never act on it. I feel like there’s another life I am not allowed to access. And I just don’t get it in a lot of ways. Like why does sex with another person mean I don’t love my partner anymore? Or love them less? Or if I really loved them I would only want to have sex with them. Like only desiring to have sex with one person forever just doesn’t feel natural to me. I just don’t get it. Why are we allowed to experience deep connection with others outside our relationship in every other way but sex is somehow off-limits? And being intimate with someone else physically means I don’t love the person, but any other type of intimacy is fine and natural, and doesn’t interfere with the relationship. Of course, we have emotionally intimate relationships with other people. If a partner limited emotional intimacy to only them we would think they were extreme and controlling. And we can have emotionally intimate relationships with multiple people and not question if our love for our partner is real. What’s with this puritanical fucking society? In the age of contraception and cures or treatments to stds and ways to have safe sex, wtf is the point of monogamy and why do we tie sex to love so much anymore? To me, I think the point of monogamy in the past was to make sure men knew they were the father of their children. \n\nBut anyway the response to that post where the woman was talking about her monogamy-struggling bf really sickened me and really confirmed my fears for how our society views people questioning monogamy. For context too, I am a woman questioning monogamy vs a man questioning. I feel like we barely have any room in the conversation for women questioning monogamy, we just assume that women want monogamy and would never question it when we are in a loving relationship. I feel like we assume that when men say this they are actually going to cheat but if a woman even has these thoughts she is more likely to remain faithful despite her desires. Which is what I’ve done. Just buried my feelings and denied myself and prayed I could only love and desire my partner because that is what good people do and good people don’t cheat. But anyway the responses to this man struggling with monogamy were horrifying. Things like “you shouldn’t have to put him together. Go find someone who’s already put together.” As if non-monogamous desires are something that need to be fixed. Or things like “he’s scared of commitment like a 15 year old teenager” as if a committed monogamous relationship is a sign of maturity and vise versa non-monogamy is a sign of immaturity. Or “he telling you who he is” and “drop his ass” like even the thoughts and desires of fucking someone else while in a committed relationship make you a bad person. I can’t stand it when people say I’m not as invested in the relationship as he is. I feeling very invested in and I love and care for this person very much and have balled my eyes out, heart-broken any time I’ve tried to break up with him over these feelings. I just couldn’t do it. I just don’t feel sexually fulfilled in this relationship. I think feeling like I have to have sex with him and can’t be with others as a rule, make him undesirable to me. When we have almost broken up and we thought he was gonna go stay at his parents we would have the best sex ever after it. After we cry our eyes out we cuddle and fuck and feel closer than ever. I’ve told him that and he laughs like it’s a funny clique but it’s true! \n\nI swear it’s the obligation and the “this is what you have to do” that makes him undesirable to me. For context, I was also raised in a fundamentalist Christian home and brought up in purity culture. Though I don’t consider myself Christian anymore or holding to those values, it’s crazy how insidious they still are in my life. Things like even when a married man looks lustfully at a woman, he has already committed adultery in his heart. I get it to an extent, actions follow thoughts. I mean that seems to be the perspective of all the people in the comments of that post condemning the man as someone going to be a cheater and being a piece of shit even for questioning monogamy. Or that monogamy and marriage are the way for everyone, and anyone who even thinks otherwise is an immoral person. But anyway with purity culture I just felt like I was told no to sex my whole childhood/adolescence and felt like I never got to explore my sexuality like a normal kid would do. I felt like I missed out on that part of my life and just when I was getting over the idea that having sex before marriage made me a horrible person I got into a serious committed relationship and restricted myself again from exploring my sexuality. I finally felt almost free and overcame so many fucked up ideas just to feel trapped again. But this time by my own doing, and continual choice to stay in this relationship. I’ve had a lot of therapists tell me that maybe I just need to grieve the loss of not having those sexual experiences/exploration that I desire and grieve being so restricted as a child/teenager. And grieve that I’ll never get to have those experiences if I stay in this relationship. But I want those experiences! They are important to me! And you can see how the idea of any restrictions/rules/labels are unsexy to me now that my restriction is monogamy instead of purity culture. I just want to break free and not be told I’m a bad person simply for thinking thoughts or having desires or questioning the way we set society up. \n\nI have had one fwb relationship. Though it was the pg-13, Christian, purity culture version. And I felt much more at ease when I was just a fwb relationship. Anytime we moved to putting labels on it, I backed away from it. Putting a label on it feels like a commitment to forever. An entrapment. Why can’t we just let relationships ebb and flow as they will? I know that sounds like an avoidant attachment thing to say, not wanting to put a label on things, but why is being avoidant attachment always something that needs to be fixed? Fixed so that labels are something I look forward to, and monogamy is what I desire. Honestly I don’t want polyamory either. It sounds stressful and annoying as fuck. I just want to live my fucking life as I please moment by moment and if I feel attracted to someone and the moment is right I don’t want to have to always deny my desires because of a fucking label and some arbitrary restriction.

    "content": "hey fellow artists, I launched a single (September 16) and an album (September 30) and these are my results so far.\n\nI’m with a Brazilian indie rock band and we have a previous relase from 2019 (an EP) with around 75K plays. This EP did relatively well when launched, as we were the main indie rock act in our small town (1 mi inhabitants) around 2018-19. After this relase, we played a few gigs but were most of the time inactive and averaging around 150-200 monthly listeners for the last couple of years.\n\nWhat we did and the investment (converting BRL to USD):\n\n- PR: 714 USD. Got exposure on Rolling Stone Brazil, Billboard Brazil, the main websites in our niche, 3 out of 5 of the biggest IG accounts in our niche, and 2 curators also on IG.\n- Meta Ads (Conversion Campaigns): 300 USD. Cost per result is at 0,74 USD generating around 405 listeners.\n- Showcase Campaign for the Single: 178 USD. Cost per listener was 0,80 USD. Generated 222 listeners.\n- Organic Promo on IG + X (the only social media we have).\n\nI have some questions:\n\n1 - What would you do if you were at the same situation? Our goal is to keep growing our audience and to be able to make shows again in our hometown + nearby cities and eventually being able to play at bigger cities like Sāo Paulo and Rio.\n2 - Should I choose Meta Ads or Showcase on Spotify? Keep both?\n3 - Should I start on tiktok or go all gas no brakes on IG?\n4 - When should I be releasing new music? What would be the best timing?\n\nTy!",

Tumawag siya sa amin medyo early in the morning at humihingi siya ng tulong para mapa-Lalamove yung ID niya.\n\nKahit medyo antok pa kami, nagbook ako ng Lalamove, naghanap si Dad ng paperbag at sinecure namin gamit stapler para di mahulog ID niya. Kami na din nagbayad (Cubao -> Taguig).\n\nWhen she got the ID, the first thing she did was to call us and reprimand us kasi apparently ang ginamit namin na paperbag had a design of an anime character from a game that she played. Honestly, hindi ko pinansin yung design ng paperbag dahil medyo half-asleep pa ako nun. It was a standard brown paperbag, di ko alam may design talaga siya. I said sorry kasi hindi namin talaga alam, pero I told her na it's just a paperbag and at least she got to work.\n\nShe got angrier and kept on scolding me through the phone saying it's \"not just a paperbag, I brought it from abroad pa.\"\n\nI told her na the paperbag was in her possession now so at least it is safe. She said, \"That's not the point.\"\n\nI told her na the paperbag wasn't torn or folded or tattered naman and is intact naman save for the small stapler markings. She said, \"That's not the point.\"\n\nI told her na the content of the paperbag was important because she needed to get to work. She said, \"That's not the point.\"\n\nThen she started crying and continued to scold us. I told her that we're unaware of the paperbag's design or importance and we're sorry for that, but she was still angry and accused us with \"wala kayong paki sa gamit ko\". \n\nAt this point, I was already frustrated. I asked her if the anime character on the paperbag was more important than getting to work. She said, \"That's not the point.\"\n\nShe was so angry. I couldn't believe she was so furious over an ANIME PAPERBAG. We already apologized and everything and I don't know what else she wanted us to do or say. She hasn't even said thank you yet. \n\nBinaba ko agad yung cellphone kasi potek hindi ako makapaniwala na umiiyak siya dahil sa PAPERBAG?? Tawag siya nang tawag pero di ko sinasagot kasi di ko rin alam ano gusto niya mapala sa convo namin.\n\nABYG kasi di ko gets bakit ang lala ng iyak ni Ate dahil sa anime paper bag???",

    "content": "Hello everyone, I wanted to make a quick recap of my climb to MasterBall this season.\n\n\n\nWhenever I play Ranked, what I hate the most is not being able to play my game (aka bricking) or over-relying on a specific card for some common matchups. I tried some options, including old favorites and new players in the meta. For example, I used Arceus Daycare last meta and while it's pretty nice, it's really tough into Oricorio, which you face quite often so that's pretty annoying. I tried the new grass decks and Decidueye having no draw power + reliance on Rare Candy to get going meant you completely brick sometimes.\n\n\n\nEventually, I decided to try my own spin on a good ol' Silvally-Rampardos list. My idea was to use two Reds and Rocky Helmet to make sure you can OHKO everything standing in your way (with some slight exceptions).\n\n\n\nWhat I like about this deck is that you always start with your ideal Pokemon. It's pretty straight-forward and doesn't get blocked by Oricorio. It also feels pretty good in the meta right now. I mostly faced Suicune and Electric decks on the way to MB. Electric is heavily favored unless you draw very poorly. Suicune didn't feel bad to face but you have to actively think about how to use your Type:Null and when to bench things in the early game. All other gameplans are straightforward.\n\n\n\nI had a +-75% win rate from UB3 to MB.\n\n\n\nSome notes about my list and my games:\n\n\n\n\\- Type:Null is actually super clutch, you don't always want to evolve your first one. It's sometimes nice to just attack with a Null while you power up a back up on the bench. 20 ping into Silvally + Red (120) can kill most uncapped EXs for example. 20 ping + Rampardos / Red combo also kills almost everything. There were games won off a Red+Null attack after Silvally weakened an EX too.\n\n\n\n\\- 2x Red was the whole reason I wanted to try this deck. Rampardos gets OHKOs very often with them. For the few Pokemons sitting above 150HPs, you will be trying to ping them with Null or have Rocky Helmet set up the kill for Ramp.\n\n\n\n\\- 0 Cyrus, I almost never regretted not having it. This deck really aims at getting OHKOs so you're barely ever trying to kill something that is sitting on the bench. The main exception were games where I would have liked to finish off a baby because Null only did 20.\n\n\n\n\\- The main cards I often wish I had were: Giovanni / Pokemon Communication / Cyrus. Giovanni sets up OHKOs vs Babies with Null and also give a 140 swing with Rampardos for OHKO vs Darkrai/Suicune. Pokemon Communication would have been nice to trade a Silvally for a Ramp in some cases. Cyrus for obvious reasons. If you wanna try them, I'd recommend slotting them over Iono (although Iono was the closest card I could use that was \"draw power\" to get out of clunky hands/give myself a shot at getting Rampardos going) or maybe even using 2 Gio over 2 Red.\n\n\n\n\\- In some cases, I kinda wanted Mars to be a Red Card so I could disrupt hand + supporter at the same time, but Mars also powers up Silvally and is stronger in the mid game. Regardless, you really need at least one hand disruption card in this meta otherwise too many decks have too many options at their disposal.\n\n\n\n\\- Don't forget that if you're KOing yourself with Rampardos and you have nothing on the bench, you will lose and not tie (unless your opponent has no benched Pokemon either). This actually comes up more than you'd think.\n\n\n\nI know it's a long text for a simple deck but I wanted to share my experience and I think it could be helpful if you want something consistent for your MB climb!",

Just taking some time for self care, in a city I love, with lots of my favorite restaurants and activities. I mean, he went all out. Best hotel, 1st class flights. Told me no budget, just have fun. \n\nAwesome, right!? Except, I've only spent one night away from my daughter since she was born, and that was for my father's funeral. I wasn't even gone 24 hours. This is 4 days. My husband is perfectly capable. He is a great dad, and our pups are in good hands with a sitter, but I'm just sitting in the beautiful hotel missing my babies. I know it's ridiculous. My husband travels frequently, so he gets that time away. Usually, if a work trip is in a location he wants to visit, he will stay a few extra days, and my daughter and I have taken girl trips together, so he can go do things he likes. It feels strange and selfish that I'm not enjoying myself. \n\nI haven't told my husband. He would be so deflated that he did all this, and instead of enjoying it, I just miss my family. \n\nAnything? Advice? Pep talk? ",

    "content": "I visited epic universe on Monday with my husband, brother, and his two kids (4 and 2). \nOur day had some really special situations later in the day so keep reading!!! We arrived to the park way later than we planned around 11 am and started to make our way after getting coffees at the Starbucks in the park. \n\nI started the day taking notes so I could provide my honest opinion and review but forgot after an hour because I was having SO much fun. The park is so interactive that even if the top attraction is a long wait time there is so much to do in the surrounding areas that you never feel bored. \n\nWe started our day in how to train your dragon and we waited in line for the dragons unleashed show. We did not end up making that time and got out of line to see some other things. Next we wanted to ride the Fyre drill because of the little ones and it was out of order. At this point I was starting to get annoyed and wondering if it would really be true that we would barely get to do anything all day. My brother took the little girls to the playground in the area which they LOVED and was SO cute. They were riding dragons and running around while my husband and I waited for hiccups wing gliders. It was a 70 minute wait but it actually only took us about 30 minutes which was a pleasant surprise. The ride itself was AWESOME and well worth the wait. On the way to ministry my husband hopped on stardust racers at a 20 minute wait (guessing not great press right now) and said it was the best roller coaster he has ever ridden in his life!!\n\nNext we went to Harry Potter which I was the most excited for. I was immediately blown away with the park area itself and even though ministry was a 3 hour wait I was excited to see the shops, cafes, and the circus arcanus. We went to the candy shops and got cocktails at the moonshine bar which really put some pep in our step. I decided to not wait in line for ministry and we decided to do circus arcanus instead. Unfortunately we waited two times for the showing and it was canceled both times. So although we left without doing any of the experiences, I truly felt like the world itself was an experience and I was super happy with it. \n\nWe went to dark universe next and our littles got their face painted while my husband and I waited in line for curse of the werewolf. We waited about 50 minutes and I will say the ride itself wasn’t that exciting and wasn’t themed to indicated werewolf anything so it was just alright. But the line for monsters unchained was 25 minutes and it was INCREDIBLE. We utilized the family room for the girls and rode it twice. We grabbed pretzels which were cheap and yummy and themed! Then we stopped at the burning blade for cocktails which were pricey. About $25 but you got to keep the cup so that felt like something lol!\n\nNintendo world was what the little ones were the most excited for and let me tell you there is nothing like seeing it for the first time. The entire area is full of games that you can actively play and the donkey Kong world was absolutely wild. Like truly you could tell they sunk every penny into building it. This is where our day took an interesting turn. My older niece had thrown her shoe somewhere along the way from dark universe to Nintendo world. We looked for it and went into every shop to buy a new pair so she could ride rides safely and there were no children’s shoes anywhere. \n\nWhen we asked one of the staff they radioed the manager of Nintendo world, Tay, who came over to help us. He called some of the higher ups who came to realize they don’t sell children’s shoe ANYWHERE in the park, which is obviously not good. We waited about 25 minutes and someone came from the resort to BRING US SHOES for her, free of charge AND gave us fast passes to one high priority ride and gave us several fast passes for the smaller children oriented rides. Tay even escorted us back to Nintendo world and stayed with us the entire time. It was truly better than Disney in terms of taking care of us. \n\nBecause of this, we decided to return to Harry Potter, circus arcanus was opened for the 7:15 show which was incredible and full of beasts. My husband and I then used our fast pass to skip a FOUR HOUR LINE for battle at the ministry and they sat us right in front 😭 it was truly so magical. The detail of the que is the best part of the ride. (But I will agree that it is not worth the wait) \n\nAfter that we did all of the Nintendo world things, played games, rode the yoshi ride, and Mario kart both were about at 25 minute wait around 8 pm. We shopped around from 9-9:30 and then got hot dogs and watched the fountain show. We left right at 10:15 and had no issues getting out of the lot. My brother still has some of the fast passes and wanted to go back this week with his wife because it was really THAT EPIC. \n\nNow I know that not everyone will experience getting fast passes or skipping the line but I learned really early in the day that it was going to be what I made of it. The park is insane and there is more to do than you even realize initially. It’s breathtaking and I hope that the press and Reddit posts don’t deter you from experiencing what it has to offer! I will completely agree with other redditers that the guest service staff are there to help and kindness goes a LONG way. What they did for us was above and beyond and as they are working out these kinks like not selling children’s shoes at a children park, they are going to be willing to help you have a great experience! Let me know if you guys have had similar experiences because I can’t stop thinking about how incredible it was. (This also coming from heavy Disney people, had just done Not So Scary the night before)",

    "content": "**TLDR: Mid-level (3-4.5 YOE) internal comms employee who’s never been trusted with strategy or growth. Feel stuck, overlooked, and unsure how to break the loop.**\n\nI’ve been working in corporate communications for a few years now, mostly internal comms like newsletters, intranet content, and campaign rollouts. But if I’m being brutally honest, I’ve never actually owned anything.\n\nI’ve never built a strategy from scratch, never written messaging that wasn’t pre-approved by layers of people above me, never had real creative or strategic autonomy. My experience looks good on paper, but it’s mostly execution. I follow directions. I don’t lead.\n\nIt’s not because I don’t want to. I’ve tried to take initiative, volunteer for stretch projects, and show I can handle more, but it never leads anywhere. I’ve never been that employee, the one managers fast-track, mentor, or trust with something meaningful. I’m the steady, competent one they give extra grunt work to, not opportunities.\n\nAnd now it feels like I’ve hit a ceiling, except the ceiling is the basement. I’m not progressing, but I’m also too experienced for entry-level roles. Every new job I find ends up being another version of the same thing: micromanaged, limited, tactical. Or worse, I get hired into roles that needed someone far more senior and spend months trying to stay afloat before burning out.\n\nI feel completely stuck. I want out of corporate life, i'd love local government, higher ed, or smaller orgs, but I can’t seem to make the pivot. Recruiters either ghost me or tell me I don’t have the strategic leadership experience they’re looking for. And they’re right, I don’t, because no one’s ever let me have it.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nQUESTIONS:\n\n* How do you move forward when your experience is solid but shallow, when you’ve done the work but never owned it?\n* How do you rebuild a career when you’ve never been the promising one in the eyes of leadership?\n* And is internal comms even a sustainable path anymore if you’re not already in senior leadership?\n\n!!!!! I’m not looking for pep talks, just honest advice from people who’ve been here and somehow figured out what to do next!!!!!!!!!! ",

Can you be more than your Blood?\n\nTo deny yourself a positive answer to any of these questions, one besides “no, and innocents will die screaming as you figure it out”, is, to my mind, to close oneself off from VTM’s true potential. It locks you to characters you hold in contempt and disgust, miserable little shits who you could never truly stand being around for one reason or another. To stick to that mindset is to force yourself to make characters you HATE, filmed like Scorsese filmed Henry Hill or Jordan Belfort.\n\nWalter White HAD options. HAD a way out. A path to better things, a place where he could stop and leave it all behind, and he chose not to, largely because he is a callous, narcissistic, macho ego-tripper- personal flaws, ones he could have chosen to overcome and didn’t.\n\nThis, for kindred, is not the case- so why railroad them down the same path? Why make all of them, without exception cop-landlord-abusers you resent and despise if there was never, at any point, a choice otherwise? To say that the kindred's fall to monstrosity is inevitable, that the only two paths vampires have is \"becoming Henry Hill\" or \"becoming dust\", then you've effectively tried to write a version of breaking bad where Walt is tied to the RV, and that's a worse version of breaking bad!\n\nTo say that a vampire will inevitably die a detestable, cruel butcher is to undermine the very themes of personal horror you supposedly set out to explore, and locks you to playing someone who is deliberately repulsive and contemptible in a fucking TTRPG- the medium where you make one special character that you have to grow invested and involved in.",

I’ve worked with underserved populations, immigrant families, and Indigenous schools, and I’ve done curriculum design and child welfare work. On paper, I should be a strong candidate for mid-level roles in nonprofits, higher ed, or educational leadership.\n\nThe problem is that for the past several years I’ve been stuck in a loop of short-term or dysfunctional positions. I interview well, often make it to final rounds, and even have my references checked, but I don’t get offers. When I ask for feedback, I either get silence or vague HR language about “fit.”\n\nI’m not young enough to be cheap labor and not senior enough to be considered for director-level positions. My work has always been mission-driven rather than corporate, so I’m not sure how to pivot into more stable industries without looking scattered.\n\nI’m currently unemployed and trying to support my family. I recently got close to landing a university coordinator role, but after weeks of silence I assume it’s another near miss. I’ve applied for around 70 positions (at the one university) in the past six years, most of which I’m objectively qualified for.\n\nAt this point, I’m wondering:\n\t1.\tWhat patterns do employers see when they look at someone with a broad, socially oriented background like mine?\n\t2.\tHow can I frame my experience so it reads as strategic breadth instead of “career drift”?\n\t3.\tAre there sectors that actually value a mix of education, advocacy, and leadership experience without needing formal L&D or HR certifications?\n\nI’m open to honest feedback. I don’t need pep talks so much as perspective from people who understand how hiring really works at this level.",

I interacted with a player doing a two-person emote, which got a chuckle, and I made it about halfway across the zone before I saw a group of 3 guardians doing...something.

I love how citrusy, zingy, and edgy that splash of color can be when paired with warm, muted palettes.\n\nOur best-selling [Red Currant](https://votivo.com/collections/red-currant) uses chartreuse as one of the two colors that make up its duotone packaging. When searching for the perfect green for our new packaging, we looked for something that would capture those garden and citrus notes that make it such a powerhouse of a fragrance—and landed on chartreuse.\n\nIf you're craving a zip of brightness in your home or wardrobe, consider adding chartreuse (and burning [Red Currant](https://votivo.com/collections/red-currant)). I promise it will put a little pep in your step.\n\nxoxo,  \nLindsay  \nCreative Manager",

There were no sign on dashboard during this whole time.\n\n\\- one fine day, the jerking issue started again with no sign on dashboard…it was so bad that the car started to stop in the middle of the traffic while I slowed down or stopped for traffic signal. I had to switch to Reverse and Drive to move the car.\n\n\\- I took it to a mechanic who said there is issue with the CVT and needs to be fixed…I said ok I’ll come tomorrow. I reach home…start the car next day…the car started fine but just didn’t move So had to tow to the mechanic’s workshop.\n\n\\- The mechanic then said that he will try to rebuild the existing CVT by replacing any broken part…he tried that for a week or so but couldn’t as he didn’t find the required parts.\n\n\\- so I did some research and found a 2013 Nissan Pathfinder Platinum CVT with 24K miles on eBay. I ordered the CVT and got it replaced. The mechanic then took the car to a local programming guy who reprogrammed and removed all error codes. He drove the car with me and there were no issues.\n\n\\- I started driving back home and within 15-20 mins started to gets the jerks again…worst to add…the car stopped again in the middle of the traffic while I slowed down.\n\n\\- I took the car back to the mechanic the next day…he checked and found P17F0 error code. So he then changed my TCM with another TCM that he had and said it’s compatible. After changing the TCM when we test drove, the car was still giving jerks. So he said I need to get it reprogrammed (again).  \n\\- I took the car to the same guy who programmed a day before…that guy found two error codes P17F1 and P0826. He removed all the codes…test drove…all good.\n\n\\- I drove the car back still getting jerks…I reach home and for the first time the engine sign flashed on the dashboard (in orange color).\n\n\\- I  drive the car for some short commute (park and ride etc) since then as the jerks are bad and with the engine sign, I do not want to take chance. The car drives fine…it’s not stopping, but the jerks!\n\n\\- This all happened in last 4 weeks.\n\nAny suggestions/ advise what should I do next?",

Great conversation, and within a few minutes I am being shown a rose gold day date with diamond bezel and diamonds in the dial. She asks if I would purchase it if it were available, and at that point the only thing that came out of my mouth was of course I would buy it. After 15 minutes she comes back and says congratulations, it’s yours. I’m in utter shock. They bring out champagne to celebrate. I say let me go back to my office and figure out best way to pay, they take up to 4 credit cards. Then I look online and realize these watches are selling on gray for less than retail! I guess that’s why they offered it to me.\n\nThe high of being offered a watch is real. I went back and told them I am passing on it, wife wasn’t thrilled with dropping $80k on what she thought was a feminine watch. Have to agree, slightly feminine, but I do love the rose gold. Without the diamonds would have been better.\n\nLong story short, if you are interested in this watch, they have it in stock.\n\n",

Fast forward to 2025 — I just hit Legend Level 1 in Dying Light 2 in less than two months :) It’s a nice full-circle moment for someone who’s been playing this series for the past six years.   \n  \nMy life was also very different five years ago. When I first started playing the original game, I was a lost and stressed-out boy who didn’t know what to do with his life. But against all odds, I managed to figure it out :D I successfully finished my university degree, learned to take care of myself, and now I’m working and aligning my career path with my dreams — something I never thought I could do back then.   \n  \nAnd honestly, I wouldn’t have accomplished all that without this game and this amazing community that kept me sane during those hard times. You all helped me realize what I needed to figure out. Thank you guys :)) You’re the best.   \n  \nPS: I’ll see you again, Kyle Crane — right after I beat the second installment. ;)",

    "content": "Listen up, fellow apes. While the penny market is slow and choppy today—full of gap-and-fade traps it's the perfect time to look for names that are de-risking their story.\n\nInstead of chasing today's micro-moves, let's talk about a diagnostics play, Mainz Biomed (MYNZ), that has a clear roadmap of catalysts coming up, making it a solid target to scale into on weakness.\n\nWhy MYNZ is in the \"Setup\" Category\n\nThis company, which is focused on its non-invasive CRC test ColoAlert®, has lined up some huge events over the next six months that could easily drive a re-rate:\n\n1. Major European Expansion: They just got full authorization to market their test, ColoAlert®, in the U.K. (Sept 2, 2025) and are doing a full commercial launch in Switzerland (Sept 23, 2025). That's access to two big, new populations. Look for early revenue updates from these markets.\n2. The Big US Catalyst (Q4 2025): The company is on track to release the crucial top-line data from their eAArly DETECT 2 study by Q4 2025. This data is key because it will set the stage for their massive US pivotal study in 2026. This is the main spec catalyst to watch for.\n3. New Pipeline Validation: Beyond colon cancer, they are also moving forward with a test for pancreatic cancer (PancAlert). The program just got a boost with government funding and is entering feasibility testing. If they confirm the early, highly positive discovery results, it will add a lot of value to the pipeline.\n\nUBER SLMT AMD DHI TNMG TCRT AEI MSTR BAC GSIW ANIX ISPC ELAB HIT GPUS CCHH ABBV QUBT AMZN SES GWAV XOM XBIO BGMS AREC HOWL BMEA SFHG T ZONE CCTG NXXT CFLT ALAB RGTI GLTO LCFY TRUE PMEC BJDX EPWK DVLT SKYE BENF TELO PWM PHOE JPM TRX HUMA BNBX TTD CLIK WMT SMSI META INTU SKYE ARBE UNH MSPR INTC EPSM EDSA PANW FIG UAMY RVSN CRVO FPAY FBLG CCTG YYAI LLY RVPH PLTR ZNB DVLT BQ INDP PL SCWO ZBIO ATON MSN APM WDC GLTO CRM SNGX ELPW PCSA CLYM KLAC NKE IBM VIVK HD SMCI MTEN QCOM NVDA CLIR QTTB CISS DLXY GORV\n\nThe Bottom Line:\n\nIn slow, choppy market conditions like today's, we avoid chasing thin, newsless pumps. We focus on building positions in names that have a clear catalyst roadmap and are actively executing their business plan like MYNZ with its European commercial wins and the upcoming US data readout in Q4.\n\nManage your risk, respect key levels, and let the company's execution drive the move, not daily noise.\n\nWhat other de-risked stocks are you looking at right now?",

When the story improves and price reclaims a key level, you often get fast repricing as sidelined buyers chase confirmation.\n\n\n\nA practical plan: treat $1.60 as the pivot, use $1.55–$1.57 as your risk band, and watch VWAP adherence on 15-minute closes. If price can base above $1.60 and volume upticks into power hour, the next magnet is the prior congestion near $1.70.

    "content": "I recently got back from Galapagos (my third time) and wish someone had told me this stuff upfront before my very first trip. No fluff, just the essentials:\n\n**The Money Talk (Don't Skip This)**\n\nYou'll pay fees at the airport - **bring cash USD**, seriously:\n\n* $20 for the tourist card (they give you this on the flight from mainland Ecuador)\n* $20 Transit Control Card. Now **must be purchased online** via the official digital platform but sometime it's down so you can purchase your TCT at the airport counter. Costs $20 USD/person. Ideally, pay with credit/debit card before your flight from mainland Ecuador. Print/save digital copy; show at check-in and on-island. (This started May 29, 2025— they state no more airport counter but I've seen people buy it because they had no idea about this requirement.)\n* $100–$200 National Park fee when you land in Galápagos (depends on your nationality, if you are foreigner most likely $200)\n\nATMs in Galápagos don't properly work sometimes. Bring way more cash than you think you need just in case. The currency used on the islands is USD.\n\n**Biosecurity is No Joke**\n\nThey will inspect your luggage. No fresh food, seeds, plants, or anything with soil. Fines hit $1,100 if you mess this up (or most likely it will be kist confiscated). Just declare everything and you'll be fine.\n\nOnly LATAM and Avianca fly there, btw.\n\n**How Long Should You Go?**\n\nMinimum 5 days if land-based, 7–10 days ideal. For cruises, 5-day trips hit the highlights, but 8-10 days gets you to the really remote islands (totally worth it if you can swing it). \n\n* Book tours 3-6 months ahead (last-minute deals exist but risky for specific dates).\n\n**Cruise vs. Land-Based - Two way to explore the islands**\n\n**Cruise** = you'll see way more wildlife and hit 10+ islands. Small boats (12–20 people), 4–8 days. Yeah it's pricey ($3K budget, $6K+ luxury), BUT you can snag last-minute deals in Puerto Ayora if you're flexible. This is the move if wildlife is your thing.\n\n**Land-based** = way cheaper and more flexible. Base yourself in Santa Cruz (Puerto Ayora) or San Cristóbal. Do day tours to other islands ($100–$150). Island-hop via speedboat ($30–$50, takes 1–2 hours). Fair warning: those boat rides are ROUGH. Pack seasickness meds or you'll regret it.\n\n**What to Pack (Learn from My Mistakes)**\n\n* **Your own snorkel gear** \\- this will be the underwater trip of your life, so invest in good gear for comfort. Saves money on rentals too\n* **Underwater camera/GoPro** \\- you WILL regret not having one. Swimming with sea turtles, sharks, and penguins? You want to capture this\n* **Reef-safe sunscreen** \\- it's the law, regular sunscreen is banned\n* Quick-dry everything, good hat, water shoes (lava rocks will shred your feet)\n* Motion sickness meds (trust me)\n* Reusable water bottle\n* More cash USD (yes, again)\n\n**When to Go**\n\n* June–November = cooler, rougher seas, but penguin and whale season \n* December–May = warmer water, calmer, better for snorkeling\n\nOverall, Galapagos are awesome all over the year!\n\n**Important Rules (They're Strict About This)**\n\n* Stay 2 meters (6 feet) away from all wildlife - no exceptions\n* Stay on marked trails only\n* No touching animals (even if a sea lion approaches you)\n* No flash photography\n* No drones without special permits\n* Take all trash with you\n* Respect the islands - this place is irreplaceable\n\nGuides will enforce these rules. Don't be that tourist who gets fined or ruins it for everyone.\n\n**Phone/Internet Situation**\n\nWiFi exists in towns (Puerto Ayora, San Cristóbal) but it's slow. Most hotels have it. On cruises, expect little to no signal - honestly, embrace the disconnect.\n\nCell service: Claro and Movistar work in populated areas. If you need data, grab a local SIM in mainland Ecuador before flying out. But real talk? You won't miss your phone when you're snorkeling with hammerheads.\n\n**Need Help Planning?**\n\nFeel free to [request a free quote here](https://mytrip2ecuador.com/get-free-quote/) \\- our subreddit works with a legit 5-star local Ecuadorian agency.

This was not chump change - the tariffs cost him an extra $550 USD. \n\nIt strikes me as criminal that first off they charged tariffs on a product made in the USA that does not take a whole lot of research to validate, and secondly that the invoice for the tariffs was delivered several days after the product was delivered.  Yes, he was prepared to pay the tariffs if need be so I felt fairly safe as the seller, but I sympathize with the sinking feeling he must have felt when he opened the FedEx envelope.\n\nI recommended he fight the charges given the evidence right on the boxes of the products that they were manufactured in the USA. \n\nRidiculous!",

    "content": "A few weeks ago I noticed a significant drop off in my rings battery life. I purchased last November so they told me they would be happy to replace it at no cost because it was under warranty. I asked if something had happened to cause the issue and they said it was hardware issues. I wanted to make sure to take care of the ring properly, so I asked if it was something I had done, but was told it was a known issue and they would send a replacement. I was a little disappointed because I am getting a replacement ring with the same known issue? Also just for comparisons sake -this is my replacement ring next to my 10 month old ring. I’m disappointed, with the apparent one year battery life, and also the coloring change on an almost $500 ring. I hadn’t noticed while wearing the ring every day, but now I can see how scratched and faded it got so quickly. ",

    "content": "Hey guys, SSF always turn into a hot topic when market opens so I decided to drop my ~~2 cents~~ 82 cents on it.\n\n# 1 - SSF is fun but it has problems due to current inventory system.\n\nFirst of all, SSF (solo self-found) is fun but in my experience it gets stale pretty quickly due to the horrible inventory system we have in the game right now, and I'm not even talking about gold storage (yet).\n\nI think the current character inventory is too small, clunky and benefit some classes due to utility items filling up half of the available space. Some classes weapons are so huge it's simply not worth looting to sell it.\n\nI'm not a barbarian main but I imagine barbarians in SSF must hate having to drop a bunch of valuables just to loot a nice bardiche or felling axe. Their weapons are not better than a dagger or sword but they occupy a huge chunk of their inventory.\n\n**Short term Solution:** We know the inventory guy left the company but can we at least get 2 rows of inventory space (horizontal)? Each character starting with 2 free stashes instead of 1 would also be dope.\n\n**Long term Solution:** I know it's all planned already but we need backpacks, potion packs & utility item packs. What about quivers? Well, these will be the main feature of Dark and Darker 3.\n\n# 2 - Gold storage sucks ass.\n\nDoes anyone here loves the current gold storage system? How many of you developed carpal tunnel syndrome by transfering 50g coin purses from stash to stash, character to character?\n\nThe numbers on purses, pouches and bags are outdated. As people have already mentioned in other discussions, it's from an era where 100g was worth 1000g\n\nI know many will disagree with me here but I think removing the physical gold storage entirely and simply turning it into a number is also not the move. It became a staple of this game (even though it's ass rn)\n\nGetting more storage is satisfying and it's a nice way to notice your progression, maybe I'm a masochist but the feeling of getting your first row of 1000g bags, then selling them and upgrading to 2500g bags is nice, don't even talk about getting your first chest.\n\nThe issue here is the numbers, it NEEDS to be increased.\n\n**Solution:** Increase the numbers!\n\nPurse = 50g > 150g  \nPouch = 250g > 500g (change crafting cost to 2-2-2)  \nBag = 1000g > 2500g  \nSpectral Bag = 2500g > 10000g (yeah, massive buff because getting all of these annoying ingredients without using the market NEEDS to be something rewarding)  \nChest = 10000g > 30000g (in this scenario, bangle lord quest probably wouldn't be so easy/readily available).\n\n# 3 - SSF vs Marketplace.\n\nAs I said before, IMO SSF is fun but I also think absolute SSF gets stale. Not only due to the inventory/gold management but also because getting everything by yourself is a hassle. I don't wanna kill 27 wisps to be able to craft a mana sphere. Yeah the item is good but it's simply not worth the time in SSF.\n\nI think we need a progressive system to dictate the market/trading hall, where basic and intermediary stuff will be sellable after some time. High tier loot like legendary, uniques and artifacts would be BANNED from the market/trading through most of the season, only being sellable in later months.\n\nI'll give an example below but be aware that it wasn’t planned in detail, it’s just a rough idea so you get what I'm saying. It's probably full of flaws and I would love to hear your thoughts about it.\n\n# Marketing/Trading regulation schedule:\n\n**1st and 2nd Week:**\n\n\\- Absolute SSF, market and trading doesn't exist in this stage.\n\n**3rd Week:**\n\n\\- Basic crafting materials: Iron, flowers, silver, etc)  \n\\- Basic consumables and utility: Surgical kits, prot pots.  \n\\- Gold storage and it's ingredients.\n\n**4th Week:**\n\n\\- Consumables (up to green rarity)  \n**-** More crafting materials (copper, cobalt)\n\n**5th Week:**\n\n\\- Gear (up to blue rarity.)\n\n**= BIG GAP between week 5 and 8 explaining:** Here people will be buying and selling tons of blue \"bis\" they accumulated over the month, blue gear and gems are so abundant right now that every gear fear Timmy and their grandmas will be able to buy gear. Blue is supposed to be the new white in this stage.\n\nThose who enjoying looting/bossing/crafting will still have the purple/legendary advantage over market enjoyers, unless they arrive late at wipe (at least they can buy blues to compete with others).\n\n**8th Week:**\n\n\\- Consumables (up to blue rarity)  \n\\- Gear (up to purple rarity) - Here things will start to be like it is right now, except legendaries, uniques and artifacts are still out of trading/market.  \n\\- Rubysilver, gold and froststone ingredients and gear.\n\n**12th Week:**  \n\\- No more regulations, embrace the chaos.\n\n# Extra stuff that needs mentioning:\n\n**- MAKE ARENA SSF/minted AGAIN, MARKETPLACE ARENA = ASS**\n\n\\- Navigating the market and selling stuff is so clunky, it definitely needs a overhaul.\n\n\\- Merchants offers shouldn't be RNG (I don't wanna buy a club, I want a rapier!)\n\n\\- Quest rewards should work like tokens rewards, let us choose between 3 items.\n\n\\- Show us the refresh timers on merchants (wasn't this a thing or am I going crazy?)\n\n**-** Why is it called \"solo self-found\"? Shouldn't it be only \"self-found\"?\n\n\\- Enable goblin recovery to SSF gear.\n\nThat's it, I took a break at the start of season 6 but this season made me enjoy the game again and I would love to see DaD last years and years.\n\nSorry if formatting is wonky, I'm typing from my PC but for some reason there are a few gaps between items which I can't move/delete.\n\nEdit: I figured out how to fix the weird spaces between items",

I have done this a few times before and thought I was working with a professional classic car dealer, WRONG! MGM intentionally and deceptively failed to disclose serious material issues with the vehcile. Sales representative, Tom Denic assured me that the vehicle was in “immaculate” condition through my phone call with him at the time of purchase and the only major issue being a passenger headlight motor that was going out and only worked 50% of the time. In addition. The posting indicated the vehicle was “well maintained” and the buyer would be “proud to own this one.” Based on these representations, and my understanding of what I thought was “show room” condition; I proceeded with the purchase ($25K after talking them down from $29,994) and an additional shipment fee ($1,295) to receive in Texas. The features included made a reasonable buyer believe everything was working with the exception of the headlight motor.\n\nUpon delivery and inspection of the vehicle, I discovered numerous issues that were not disclosed and materially affect the condition, safety, and value of the vehicle:\n\n-Passenger side window motor is completely nonfunctional.\n-Driver side window motor is failing.\n-Interior window plate is missing, compromising window integrity.\n-Driver side window is falling out of track.\n-Driver side door panel is falling off.\n-Gapping between driver window and T-Tops, which will cause water intrusion.\n-Interior fuse box panel cover is missing.\n-Both interior T-Top roof covers are missing.\n-Trunk Release/hatchback will not remain open due to defective supports.\n-Keyless Entry does not work.\n-Anti-Theft System Alarm does not work.\n-Stereo Wheel Mounted Controls\n-The integrity of the rear end is compromised with faulty springs and shocks.\n\nThese defects are inconsistent with the representations made to me prior to purchase. In a series of text messages between Mr. Denic and myself, it was ultimately agreed that the vehicle would be inspected by an auto shop and that I would obtain an estimate to bring the vehicle to a reasonably safe condition, as agreed upon at the time of purchase. A few days later the inspection was shared with Mr. Denic. Their inspection also determined that the integrity of the rear end was a serious issue that needed to be addressed.\n\nLet it also be known that other vehicle postings include pictures of doors, windows down, trunks open, etc.; therefore, proving many of these material issues were known by MGM Classic Cars and purposely withheld. As of this correspondence, Mr. Denic has not responded to me as he went silent once the inspection report was shared.\n\nWhat trash...\n\nSince, I have learned they have been sued several times and there are open litigation cases against them now, some far worse than what I experieced.\n",

This EP did relatively well when launched, as we were the main indie rock act in our small town (1 mi inhabitants) around 2018-19. After this relase, we played a few gigs but were most of the time inactive and averaging around 150-200 monthly listeners for the last couple of years.\n\nWhat we did and the investment (converting BRL to USD):\n\n- PR: 714 USD. Got exposure on Rolling Stone Brazil, Billboard Brazil, the main websites in our niche, 3 out of 5 of the biggest IG accounts in our niche, and 2 curators also on IG.\n- Meta Ads (Conversion Campaigns): 300 USD. Cost per result is at 0,74 USD generating around 405 listeners.\n- Showcase Campaign for the Single: 178 USD. Cost per listener was 0,80 USD. Generated 222 listeners.\n- Organic Promo on IG + X (the only social media we have).\n\nI have some questions:\n\n1 - What would you do if you were at the same situation? Our goal is to keep growing our audience and to be able to make shows again in our hometown + nearby cities and eventually being able to play at bigger cities like Sāo Paulo and Rio.\n2 - Should I choose Meta Ads or Showcase on Spotify?

    "content": "Hi all, I'm posting to introduce and gauge interest in **DAQAstra**, a data-acquisition and control device and accompanying software stack that, I believe, addresses the vast majority of the aches and pains of setting up the electrical side of a project.\n\nThe motivation to create this system came from my initial time working at my company TransAstra. I was the only electrical engineer on staff, we had a number of different projects going on in parallel and each one needed a data-acquisition or control system. At first, I tried my hand at LabView, but we were limited by budget, didn't have the enterprise licenses, and only had non-NI hardware that was compatible with the LabView suite. This solution turned out to be a time-sink and the results were pretty unreliable (i.e. weird nested loops for state-machines and so many issues connecting to our DAQ over the serial bus). Eventually, I opted to use Arduino or ESP32s to create bespoke hardware solutions for each project. While this was more reliable than the first solution, it was, as you can image, still very time-consuming.\n\nAs I iterated on this process, I started to converge on a generic design of a DAQ that has the I/O on-board to support almost every need I would reasonably expect to encounter. At this point, I went to the higher-ups and pitched the system as a product the company should develop and market since we've found it to be cost-effective and useful. We now have a team working on DAQAstra. \n\nJust last week, DAQAstra successfully ran an experiment for our company on the [ISS](https://www.newswire.com/news/transastra-demonstrates-asteroid-capture-and-orbital-debris-cleanup-22651131) with basically the *same* software stack we run on the bench! It also is deployed in production in our network of automated space-domain awareness [telescope systems](https://transastra.com/products/tko) located in Australia, Northern California, Arizona, and another soon in Spain.\n\nAs of now, DAQAstra delivers the following capabilities:\n\n* Zero-code configuration of hardware with a large and always-growing suite of supported peripheral devices, in-firmware DSP functions (write arbitrary math functions from other configured sensors) and controller implementations (state-machines, PID, Bang-Bang, etc...). This list is always growing.\n* A cross-platform application that provides device discovery on LAN, just-in-time firmware compilation and over-the-air (OTA) updates, version control of configurations.\n* Bundled automatic time-series data storage (no more copying debug logs or SD-cards!) using InfluxDB OSS.\n* Bundled NodeRED with integrated realtime dashboard generation based on a DAQ's configuration. \n   * NodeRED also enables easy integration with other devices on your network for integration with DAQAstra or vice-versa. It is not walled-off from anything else you may use!\n* Fully documented MQTT API, you can grab DAQAstra data live or command it from your own code, if needed.\n* The codebase is 75% written in Rust (from the firmware to the application's backend) with only the UI being written in Typescript.\n\nAll of this is delivered at a price orders of magnitude lower than the competition. If anyone here’s been playing with Rust for embedded or hardware control, I’d love to trade notes. It’s been an incredibly powerful tool for me and there's always something more to learn.\n\nWhile I would be stoked if we get a few clicks on the website from this post, I am most interested in feedback and impressions from other engineers. I also am just honestly pumped that something I built to make *my own* projects easier somehow made it to orbit. \n\nI’ve included screenshots of the application's GUI, and a couple pictures of the system in action. If you’d like more info, here’s a link to our [user-guide](https://daqastra-docs-889bec.gitlab.io/index.html). In the meantime, AMA about the tech, the ISS mission, the telescopes, my experience using Rust for embedded systems, or any other questions you may have!",

I initiated HRT 15+ years ago abroad and have had all surgeries (incl. phalloplasty and hysto). My diagnosis is old enough that it says \"transsexualism\" and not GID.\n\nTrying to get my hormones switched over has been a nightmare so far. I have an appointment booked for December with an endo (with a referral), but nearest specialist trans care hospital isn't taking appointments until May 2026. \n\nThe criteria for TRICARE to cover my prescription cost looks pretty stringent; a diagnosis of GID from an in network mental health provider, and a prescription from a trans care specialist in consultation with an oncologist.\n\nQuestion:\nUhh, what do I do. I have been as proactive as I can be with all of this, as it took a while for me to get my SSN, military ID and other stuff before my insurance could fully kick in.\n\nSo far I've booked that one appointment just to get my prescription (if I pay out of pocket it is what it is). I've also sent my PCM the criteria for getting my T covered - she says the military hospitals can't administer care, but they can offer referrals. I've explained the situation via the messenger portal and asked for some guidance on referrals.\n\nAm I likely to have success with an appeals process? I have been on hormones for over a decade. If it counts, I am in a state with trans protections. I only recently got my work auth so I don't have my own insurance yet.\n\nI know this post might be likely to attract the standard \"go home\" response: this is a polite request to not give me that advice, I was long distance with my wife for 10 years and won't go back to that.\n\nIf anyone has had any recent experiences with this please lmk I'm so over it already, tysm!\n",

I’m now back to posting on this sub. \n\n“This paper describes the development of two of the most important scientific disciplines in the last quarter of the 20th century,\ncognitive science, which emerged in 1975, and nano-bio-info-cogno (NBIC) converging technologies, which emerged in 2000. In\nthis century, we will achieve cross-disciplinary integration, innovation in comprehensive knowledge and comprehensive devel-\nopment in human resources. NBIC converging technologies will greatly expand human cognition and communication, improve\nhuman health, enhance social outcomes, strengthen national security and unify science and education. Cognitive science and con-\nverging technologies will have major effects on the future human development. I argue that the 21st century represents an age of\nsynthesis, reflected in the continual reintegration between scientific disciplines in recent times. This new age of synthesis will\nrequire innovations in thought and methodology that differ from those underlying the age of analysis in the 20th century. I predict that these developments will allow every individual to realize comprehensive development. Accordingly, the education system will be transformed, and a comprehensive human resources system will be created.”\n\n“In 2000, a research program sponsored by a NSF grant awarded to the World Technology Evaluation Center (WTEC) sought to identify the leading fields of science in the new century.

The consensus that emerged identified the importance of nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science, leading to the combination of these fields into a new discipline referred to as NBIC converging technologies.\n\nThis development heralded a new era of scientific development in the 21st century, focused on the integration of\nnumerous disciplines in science and technology. The 21st century thus constitutes an \"age of synthesis\".”\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11434-010-4005-7\n\nhttps://scispace.com/pdf/the-age-of-synthesis-from-cognitive-science-to-converging-4fhww8fu04.pdf\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/225946384_The_age_of_Synthesis_From_cognitive_science_to_converging_technologies_and_hereafter",

PayPal made my account balance -$647.81 (Cost of item). Said I couldnt refund because my balance was negative. I uploaded pictures into the case that I was transferring money from my bank into paypal to bring balance to zero. PayPal considers that my official response and send the ball back into buyers court. Buyer rejects claim and in turn allows me to process the refund. Buyer is saying they cant ship back for another week. So case is open but waiting for buyer. PayPal completes the transfer from my bank, my balance is $0.00.\n\nToday, I sell an item for $691 through G&S invoice. I go to withdrawal and my account is locked. I cannot do anything besides refund. They need proof of fufilment for past 3 items (excluding the returned one) and a photo of my id. Says it will take 3 days. I feel I should not ship this item until my account is unlocked.\n\nQuestions:\nIs this my fault?\n\nIs this the second buyer from today using some weird payment that is causing this?\n\nWhat are the chances my account unlocks?\n\nIs this all related to the original return and refund?\n\nplease help!!!\n ",

    "content": "Even if HSR is a single player game so who is broken and who isnt only matter as long as you can clear content, which tbf units from 3.0 til now hasnt gotten much issue clearing 3 main end game contents(MoC,PF,AS). Despite Cas being one of the only viable comp for AA, it being a \"whale only\" mode still make it acceptable.\n\nBut i genuinely question whats the thought process of Hoyo in creating and designing Cas. \n\n1st is balance trade offs. Every characters has to be strong in 1 aspect at the trade off in other. For example playing sustainless gives you extremely high damage ceiling but the fragility of a paper. For HP scalers, who are by design significantly tankier than regular atk scaling dps and so to limit their ceiling, making HP scalers requires a healer is actually a great move from Hoyo, Mydei is a clear example (while yes he can play sustainless but the difference is marginal).\n\nWhich is why i want to ask, on what green Earth was in Hoyo's mind designing a team comp that have 4 times the effective HP of a regular atk scaling team comp (HP scalers have twice and then their memosprite too) while still having the highest damage output in every team comp in the game. Even before Evernight that pushes Cas to be the definitive best dps in the game, Cas with just Hyacine was the best dps in the game which Phainon being a close 2nd. So even without shilling teammates and contents, Cas as an HP scaler was already the tankiest team comp with the highest damage output. Which again begs the question \"whats the trade off\".\n\n2nd Abnormally Arbitration, damage inflation and a requirement of sustain. HSR for about 2 years of it release has been design as a damage rush type of game, it doesnt matter you are on 1 HP if the enemy hits 0 first, which is why sustainless has been very popular to a lot of people. But in recent times, not just HP inflation but enemies also has their damage output inflated, enemies been slowly having an increase in damage modifiers, along side having a \"nuke\" that deletes team comps which make sustains a requirement to clear end game. And guess whose ceiling is not affected by running sustains. \n\nBack in 3.2, on Cas initial releases, her damage output was on par with sustainless dps but because she requires a healer so it wasnt as bad. One can choose to play sustainless for a higher damage output or play Cas for comfortability. But now,like mentioned above, because enemies starts to hit harder, sustainless is hardly an option to consider anymore(even for Phainon). And because the only advantage atk scaling dps has over HP scaling dps is gone, Cas higher scaling to offset requirements of a healer is now what rockets her to be miles ahead of other dps\n\nAnd this was in context of people complaining about powercreep around 3.0 even. Like yea, team comp were dealing ~7m dmg is way too much powercreep, how about we push that to 25m on a comp with sustain. Like good job Hoyo, you made Riot's game balacing team look competent\n\nHow to fix this? Well the short answer is you cant without completely powercreep Cas out of the meta along side with everything up until 4.0. And heading to 4.x, while we'll probably shift to a new meta with new niches (like idk, Eff Res scaling dps or smthg), HP scalers(Cas) will get less update, but at the current state, the fact that they have competent damage output while still being tanky as hell will means to push newer releases, Hoyo would need to make bosses even more tailored made. Like imagine we get 3-4 Pollux in a row for different dps releases.\n\nBut assuming Cas is somehow powercrept out of the meta(at the cost of everything until 4.0), how to prevent these type of situation to not happen again if for some reason HP scalers are back into the meta or Hoyo make Def scaling dps? Well you can incorporate semi survivability into atk scaling dps/atk scaling supports, like Anaxa for example, his \"Sublimation\" can cut inbetween enemies extra turns,cutting their action and thus damage by half or Hysilens atk reduction, as a result putting less strain on sustaining; a team with like 2-3 semi survivability skill will allows atk scaling dps to be able to play more aggressive(sustainless) to keep the balance of \"damage output\"-\"survivability\". Allow sustainless runs at a risk for higher damage output or comfortability for lower damage output.\n\nHere's tldr:\n\nHP scalers have no trade off between survivability and damage output and thus as the game evolves to force the requirement for a sustain, atk scaling dps falls behind as sustainless is no longer an option and this horrendous state of game balance is demonstrated by Cas as a team, having 4 times as much effective HP while having a damage output of a sustainless team comp",

    "content": "\nokay this is gonna be long and I’ll try to make it as not confusing as possible \n\nAround two years ago in 2023 I had a best friend (F/18) which I’ll call Sam for now. She and I had been friends since 2022 but we used to constantly have arguments and the worse part is the argument would mostly be about guys. To give you guys an example she had a guy she liked and I noticed that sometimes when we were around him she would say jokes that would put me down like calling me fat or he would do the same and she wouldn’t defend me or bat an eye. Another problem came when I had a guy I liked but she refused to show the texts between them knowing full well I liked him and I didn’t like how secretive she was being about it.\n\nSo fast forward to early 2023. She had an ex boyfriend who was also in our friend group and me and a diff guy had been tgt for around 6-7 months and throughout our relationship I started to feel a lot and I mean A LOT more resentment towards Sam. Because sometimes she would randomly join our discord call and the both of them would talk and forget about me, or sometimes she would say embarrassing things about me in front of him and sometimes he described his type to be the opposite of me but then proceed to say that Sam is that kind of girl. I know all of this just seems like I’m putting the blame only on her but no. I was so angry at both of them and I hated the fact that she didn’t do anything about it\n\nSo one day, I wanted to talk to her about something private. But the moment I said “Hey can we talk about something?” She suddenly she thinks she knows what I wanna talk about and I kinda pretended I knew so that I could see what she meant and she proceeded to send me around maybe 5? Screenshots of her and my at the time boyfriend talking\n\nBut they weren’t just talking\nThey were both talking badly about me and my bad traits, she also tried convincing him that I was talking to another guy a lot knowing full well he was jealous about me and that guy\n\nSo when I read everything my heart dropped and I cried from 12am to 5am without getting any sleep. If there’s something I regret I really regret forgiving him but that’s besides the point right now.\n\nSo school the next few days were awkward and basically me and her were also in one big friend group which in the friend group I had another best friend, same age, I’ll call her Sienna. Sienna and me have been friends longer than Sam and I so when Sienna noticed that something was off about me I opened up the whole thing to her and ever since that day she started distancing herself from Sam because she found it rude and disgusting that she could do something like that to me knowing full well I was her best friend.\n\nAnd I don’t remember exactly how he asked or how he found out but her ex boyfriend that I’ll call Jay which is also Sienna and I’s very close friend found out about what she did and he felt really upset and disappointed in her so he distanced himself from her too.\n\nAt that point all hell broke lose in the friend group and we got separated into two groups where there were two of our friends on her side and two of our friends on mine. And long story short one day both of our groups got into a really bad argument where Jay and Sienna felt really mad for me so they argued with Sam’s two friends and when Sam got into the argument they started saying hateful stuff to her like how she’s a “pick me girl” and stuff like she’s manipulating her two guy friends to be her dog and things js got really messy\n\nDuring that time period she would also talk badly about me a lot but I’m not gonna lie and say I didn’t. She told people bad things about me and her two friends on her side would constantly bully me in calls and since they were my at the time bfs friends they would try to get me and him to break up, which eventually ended up working by the way. \n\nFast forward one day through a really heated day we had an argument in school and we talked it out for an hour? Then we went home and called for two hours and we decided to stop the whole argument.\n\nAfter that at a birthday party me and her started getting closer again and we went back to being best friends and way healthier than before. We both apologized to each other and she expressed to me how hurt she felt when she saw Jay defending me because he was her ex boyfriend and I also expressed how upsetting it was when I saw her and my ex talking badly about me.\n\nNot long after I had to transfer schools but me and her obviously still kept contact after that. She came to my house and we went out together a lot but eventually we started drifting and it was for no reason at all just her getting new friends which were all my friends before I transferred that she hated but I tried my best to not let it bother me \n\nSo now to the current problem. I have been friends with this one girl I’ll call her Vienna from my old school before transferring and we became closer after meeting through a friend and we realized we had a lot in common but here’s the thing, she is one of Sam’s best friend. \n\nWhen Vienna first met me, me and her didn’t hit it off quite well and I later found out that it’s because after I left my old school Sam would spread rumors to me about everyone and about our argument but she always  left out the part where she spoke badly ab me to my ex boyfriend which is the whole reason it happened.\n\nNow Vienna and I realize we are both going through almost the same thing because her and Sam got into an argument because Sam refused to stop talking to Vienna’s ex boyfriend after they broke up which led to them distancing a bit.\n\nBut after Sam found out me and Vienna are friends she got so upset and just stopped talking to Vienna and when Vienna asked her about it she would say that I am the cause of all her trauma and she’s paranoid but I truly feel like she’s just paranoid of Vienna finding out about what she did to me instead of the fake story.\n\nNow Vienna and I refuse to cut off each other just to make her happy but a friend of ours think that we should stop being friends. \n\nAITA for being friends with her?

And I'm genuinly worried it will affect her health.\n\nI have been trying to get her to work out more,  I told her to go on walks, wich she has been doing, and I have started a routine for us to go to the gym tgt.\n\nThe thing is her eating, really she eats a lot, wich wouldn't be so bad if it weren't because she eats junk food, and I don't even think she realizes how unhealthy she eats.\n\nI never judge her for what she eats so she feels comfortable eating whatever in front of me. But the thing is I have realized she eats so bad and she doesn't even realize how unhealthy what she's eating is (the worst day she ate a 700 karb dessert and a pizza as a dinner and then bought 2 extra 700karb dessert for the next day).\n\nI'm genuinly concerned and I really think she needs some type of wake up call but I know that it will hurt her so bad if I tell her what I think because she already receives bad comments from her weight. But I'm really concerned she is gonna have health problems and I think that having such an unhealthy lifestyleis only affecting her mentak heatl more. I really need to tell her smt but idk how to approach the subject or what to tell her for her to both listen to me and not be hurted.",

    "content": "**SEC EDGAR FILING ALERT**\n\n## Company Information\n- **Company:** **TARGET CORP** ($TGT)\n- **Form Type:** 8-K\n- **Filing Date:** 10/9/2025\n- **Trading Significance:** **MEDIUM SIGNIFICANCE** - Notable market activity\n\n## Insider Details\n- **Name:** Reporting Person\n- **Title:** N/A\n- **Relationship:** N/A\n\n## Transaction Details\n- **Transaction Type:** N/A\n- **Security Type:** Common Stock\n- **Shares Transacted:** N/A\n- **Price per Share:** N/A\n- **Total Value:** N/A\n- **Shares Owned After:** N/A\n- **Acquisition/Disposition:** N/A\n\n## Market Context\nThis SEC EDGAR filing provides transparency into insider sentiment and trading activity. Consider this information alongside broader market conditions and fundamental analysis.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## 📊 COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\n#### SEC Filing Analysis: Target Corporation (TGT)\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\n- **Trading Significance**: Medium\n- **Key Takeaway**: Target Corporation has successfully renewed its primary credit facility, securing $1.0 billion in liquidity to support operations, demonstrating financial prudence and strong banking relationships.\n- **Market Impact**: The filing is expected to have a neutral to slightly positive impact, reinforcing investor confidence in the company's financial stability rather than acting as a direct catalyst for stock price movement.\n\n#### Company Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Company | Target Corporation |\n| Ticker Symbol | TGT |\n| CIK | 0000027419 |\n| Industry | Retail-Variety Stores |\n\n#### Filing Details (Form 8-K)\n\nThis filing is a Form 8-K, which is used to announce major events that shareholders should know about. It is not an insider trading filing (Form 4).\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Form Type | 8-K |\n| Event Date | 2025-10-09 |\n| Event Type | Item 1.01: Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement |\n| Agreement | 364-Day Credit Agreement |\n| Value | $1.0 billion (with a $500 million expansion option) |\n| Purpose | To provide liquidity and replace a prior credit agreement dated October 15, 2024. |\n\n#### Market Impact Analysis\n\n#### Stock Impact Prediction\n\n- **Direction**: Neutral to Slightly Positive\n- **Reasoning**: Securing a large credit facility is a sign of financial health and prudent management. It assures the market of Target's ability to meet its short-term obligations and navigate economic uncertainties. While not a growth driver, it reduces perceived financial risk.\n\n#### Volume & Sentiment\n\n- **Expected Volume Impact**: Low. This is a routine corporate finance event and is unlikely to trigger significant trading volume.\n- **Sentiment Indicator**: Mildly Bullish. The confirmation of liquidity and backing from major banks like Bank of America and Citibank is a positive signal for long-term stability.\n\n#### Investment Insights\n\n#### Positive Market Indicators\n\n- **Enhanced Liquidity**: The $1.0B facility provides a substantial buffer for operational needs.\n- **Strong Banking Relationships**: The participation of major banks as lead arrangers indicates strong creditworthiness.\n- **Proactive Financial Management**: Renewing the facility well before the prior one expired shows foresight in capital management.\n\n#### Risk Factors\n\n- **Covenant Requirements**: The agreement contains customary financial covenants, such as a leverage ratio, that Target must maintain. Failure to do so could trigger a default.\n- **Dependence on Credit**: While standard, reliance on credit facilities carries interest costs and is subject to market conditions upon renewal.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Financial Stability**: Target has solidified its financial backstop for the upcoming year.\n2. **Business as Usual**: This is a renewal, indicating a continuation of Target's established financial strategy rather than a reaction to a new crisis.\n3. **No Immediate Stock Catalyst**: The event is more relevant for fundamental analysis of the company's balance sheet health than for short-term trading signals.\n\n#### Contextual Analysis\n\n#### Timing Significance\n\nThis filing is a routine annual renewal of a credit facility. The timing is not indicative of any specific corporate event or distress; rather, it's part of a standard corporate finance calendar.\n\n#### Transaction Context\n\nThe new 364-Day Credit Agreement replaces a similar agreement from the previous year. This structure is common for large retailers to manage working capital, especially to handle seasonal inventory builds. The interest rate is tied to SOFR plus a margin based on Target's debt ratings, which is standard for such facilities.\n\n#### Company Context\n\nAs a major retailer, Target's business is cyclical and requires significant working capital. This credit facility provides the necessary flexibility to manage inventory, operational expenses, and other short-term liabilities effectively.\n\n#### Risk Assessment\n\n#### Risk Level: Low\n\n#### Risk Factors\n\n- The primary risk is not the agreement itself, but the underlying business performance required to meet its covenants.\n- A significant downturn in Target's profitability could strain its ability to comply with the leverage ratio covenant.\n- Changes in interest rates (SOFR) will affect the cost of borrowing if the facility is drawn upon.\n\n#### Market Considerations\n\n- In a stable economic environment, this filing is a non-event.\n- In a recessionary environment, having a secured credit line is a significant strength and a competitive advantage.\n\n---\n\n**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**: This analysis is for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

And the sad thing is as we grow up my old online Love community drifted apart (growing up, them not being tgt and military didn't help). So my goal here is to find our fellow Loves, starting by doing this post.\n\nWhat's your favourite NU'EST moment and why?\n\nI'll share mine first. Oddly enough I think mine is when they went into the haunted house in FujiQ Highland in NU'EST Road. I really thought about it on my own, and at first I'd suppose it'd be something like the first NU'EST win, Segno's opening, or something big like that. But no, I think I treasure how they are with each other more. \n\nI think the whole:\n\n1. Mingi bringing up crazy idea (aka sending one of them into the haunted house alone)\n\n2. Dongho setting Mingi up \n\n3. All of them planning to scam Mingi\n\n4. Jonghyun purposefully choosing chocolate flavor (as a small sorry I guess?) for Mingi\n\n5a. Being very scared, Mingi still pushed through and made it out\n\n5b. Minhyun regretted listening to how scared Mingi was\n\n6. Them showing love for Mingi when he's back, Minhyun even dusting his pants for him\n\n7. Aaron scamming by pretending he went in\n\n8. Dongho being very scared and went through with Minhyun and Jonghyun\n\n  \nreally summed up what NU'EST is, right? Obviously they know each other well and have deep love towards each other. They are playful but when they are met with difficulties, they face them head on and went through with the help and support of each other. And stupid me tearing up thinking of them tgt now... Please I'd love to talk about the good old days with you guys, looking forward to chat in the comments.",

    "content": "Good morning everyone and thanks for all the great posts, trades, thoughts I've been seeing. We're starting to get more of exactly what I hope to see:  YOUR thoughts, analysis, questions and trades. I was hoping that the sub wouldn't just dry up while I am off galivanting (that's the first time I've ever written that word) out in Yellowstone. Today is our last full day here and we're going to cozy-in and prepare to leave in the AM. The weather is turning so we're leaving 3 days early.\n\n**State of the Bull**\n\nDespite the recent rally, nothing has really changed in what I think is coming for this bull run. It has been absolutely fantastic. It's still displaying toppy action, more as a waning bull. The volatility and amplitude of the moves is most certainly coming in and we're drifting higher rather than charging forward. This could change at any moment based on news or economic events but, at this juncture, we have to be happy with just percolating higher.\n\nI still think it's phenomenal in that we coasted through Sept. and the 25 bps Fed cut, and are weathering this govt. shutdown. Two more cuts still factored into the equation as well. I guess you could say we're at a point of parity but, to me, this bull is getting tired.\n\n **Can we spell \"GAINS\" without AI?**\n\nI haven't checked the breadth recently of this bull run but it's still clearly favoring the AI names. Without them, there's no way we have the bull we have now. In fact, dare I say, my bet is if I got into the data, it would show that the S&P would be mostly flat. I may get into that a bit later today if I have the time.\n\nThat said, that is no slight against this bull run. Most bulls are characterized by a particular segment that fuels the sentiment and gains to be had. Some have argued with me that the .com bubble years doesn't serve as a base case or historical model for this bull run. To be fair, I have yet to liken this bull to the \"bubble\" years but it does remind me of the rise of the Internet back in the mid 90s. If anything, we are just now starting to see some of the bubblecious elements that were present later in the 90s, but we're clearly not there yet. Late in the 90s, we started seeing an insane number of new IPOs, and the micro cap players started seeing, sometimes, ridiculous rallies. \n\nI know this because I lived it and profited handsomely from it. In fact, I was one of Tokyo Joe's inner-circle \"lieutenants\" late in the 90s. Nothing official in that term but it his how he referred to me and I was still young and impressionable at that stage in my market experience so catching on with a formal trading group was very exciting.\n\nSo, all in all, this AI fueled rally doesn't scare me off in the least. It's healthy and I continue to believe that this AI opportunity is the second greatest investment opportunity since the .com period.\n\n**TikTok**\n\nI have thrown my hate into the TikTok ring a bit. I'm terrible at it and, in fact, I don't really plan to improve , at least in the way of video editing etc. The last thing I want is to spend more time in front of a screen, especially with TikTok with copious amounts of editing to make my videos seem more \"professional.\" People will just have to take me as I am.\n\nI'm not publicly posting the link to this sub as we don't need a bunch of trolls swarming us here. It's Trolly (troll-y) enough as is with many making fun of my market analysis. But hey, at least they haven't made personal insults yet. LOL. I have thick skin so I'm sure that's coming. I am providing the link via DM for those interested as I find those who take the time to reach out are looking for something different and it gives me an opportunity to mention what we're about here at TIC, before giving the link\n\n**Random Shots**\n\nWe've some some interesting action in quite a few names in the last few days.\n\n* $AMD - Crazy, crazy movement on the back of the OpenAI investment news. I'm going to have to trim the position at this point.\n* $NVDA - Getting another push to new highs as Jensen says that demand is not slowing. Last I checked, NVDA was close to $4.7T\n* Mag7 outside of $NVDA is lagging today but that's not an indictment after the move we've had\n* AI Energy has been riding the wave. This is one of those areas I'm so comfortable with for investment. I only have $CEG and $VST at this juncture, having missed $TLN and $GEV, but that's fine. The positions aren't getting trimmed.\n* $FIG is finally retracing just a bit. I'm watching for potential momentum based entry\n* $BROS is leading my list today after a long period of erosion. It's a long term growth hold for me and I'd like another 2 units or so.\n* $RGTI and $QBTS have been explosive. Probably not going to get another opportunity at $18 for QBTS. \n* $TOST - Probably time to take another couple of units or my LEAPS here. I've been waiting to see if the market would roll over first.\n* $RDDT has been struggling and I watching to see if it's going to break lower or rally off $200. I'm reluctant to add more shares while the market is extended. RDDT is not a stock that will buck the trend.\n* $CRWV has been strong but still meeting some resistance around the $140 level. Need to break above with volume. This name has the DNA to break and run over $200. Wanted leaps around $90 but didn't take them when I had the chance.\n* $DELL finally having weakness after a huge run. $VRT is right there too but showing more resistance\n* $BABA is finally selling off a bit, potentially providing an opportunity for me. I want another U or two, maybe even LEAPS, but I missed that again at $105.\n* $NEM - What's that?!? One of my strongest stocks is down materially? And a gold stock on top of it? I never expected NEM to do what it is doing, but I thought it had upside to $60. It was an early yield play for me but that has now been cut more than in half with the huge rise.\n* $SWK can't seem to get above resistance. I've been wanting to see this yield play head toward $80.\n* $DECK has faded below $100 again damn it. Was hoping to see a sustained rise above $120 with new support put in. Instead, it's fading but toward lower support.\n* $LYB fading lower again as well. Was hoping to to see it sustain $55. Still holding because yield is solid and safe it seems, but this sector has been beaten.\n* I mentioned $VRT already but this huge winner continues to impress. No plans on trimming this position after the 100 points of rise from the tariff tantrum. \n* $ANET was one of my bigger LEAPS mistake. I shouldn't have taken those profits after I took the position when it was at $60. I sold out with a big gain just above $90. Oops. I knew the name was a favorite of hedgies and institutions but wanted to trim those profits due to uncertainty. \n* I still hate $TGT. I may just sell ... but as long as they keep their dividend, I'm willing to keep holding. We'll see how I wake up tomorrow AM.\n* $NKE can't break and hold over $72. I'm still holding and will continue to do so.\n\n**Final Word**\n\nThat's all for now. I'm thankful that the market has been doing well while I've been away. It makes it much easier to be out of comm range knowing that nothing significant is going on. Much more difficult to travel when we have major volatility. \n\nI'm still a huge believer in \"being quiet\" as it allows the market to come to me while not trying to force trades. That's the toughest thing to do in trading, not force trades. Anyone can be profitable in an up market, it's when things go sideways or down with volume that things get treacherous. As mostly a long term investor now, it makes life a lot easier as you can ride the waves, bail when you need to, and add sail  when the opportunity presents itself.\n\nOh great, now a sailing metaphor.\n\nHave a great Thursday.\n\nTJ\n\n*  \n\n",

    "content": "I've always struggled with friendships. Not making them, keeping them. Up until now, my biggest record is 4 years so... you can imagine. Now the bsf I am currently talking about has been friends with me for 4 years. Yup, she's the record holder. But I'm afraid I'm not breaking this record anytime soon. My bsf and I are in a slightly big fg tgt. I've know her from before we joined this fg (we joined 2 yrs ago). We weren't always best friends, but we got really close last year. Like, everyday we'd call and text, kinda close. However, throughout our friendships, I'd always have an issue with her bc she'd always lie about why she couldn't call me when I did. I mean, it's not that big of a deal but she began doing that really often, she'd take hours and sometimes even days to reply my texts. I brought it up to her many times, I told her how I didn't like it. I always gave her a lot of excuses and space to work on it. I have really deep rooted abandonment issues, and she should've known best. But I guess her own issues came first. I tried to be understanding, so I gave her even more space. but in doing so, I accidentally created this drift between us. She never once tried to reach out to me first, it was always me. So when this drift was created, she ofc, didn't give a shit. Every time I tried to bring up these issues, she always used the excuse of \"But I've changed!\" or \"At least I'm trying.\" or \"I'm different bow.\" yea, your \"change\" only came when I had to repeatedly remind you. We even had to set a time limit to text back (like we have to text back within 2 hours) just so we'd have a basic conversation. Like, was it really that hard for you to talk to me. But whatever, at least at that point we were still locked in, until we weren't.  \nHer and this other girl in our fg live really close tgt, So during the holidays I guess they were going to each other's houses a lot. When school reopened, they were basically stuck together like glue, while I was just constantly left out at the side of the group. My bsf wld always get her Starbucks, they'd always hang out at their local playground until late at night. I was so hurt and sad, but I wanted to be understanding once again. I brought it up to my bsf, but I told her it was fine because they are friends and I can't limit them. I just wanted her to understand that her actions do still hurt me. She told me she never knew I felt that way (like what, did I not matter so much that my disappearance from your life meant nothing??) and I thought that would be the end of the issue. But no. As the year progressed it got even worse. They would call every night, text daily. They had their own set of mutual friends and people begun associating them with each other. I'd never even see them in school because they always ran off with each other. Funny thing, that girl used to really like me too, until she too, replaced me. During lessons, I'm sat with my bsf, bc you know, in name we were still supposed to be the \"duo\", when I'd talk to my bsf, she'd always give me an excuse to ignore me, even if I was in the middle of a deep/traumatic topic. For example, she'd say \"I want to focus on the lesson\" which is not wrong until 2 mins later she either pulls out her ipad to watch Youtube or falls asleep. That's the shit she'd rather to than fucking talk to me. Then came a point when she started comparing things I do to the other girl, saying things like \"Oh you're just like \\_\\_\\_\\_\" or \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ is the number one \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ , you are number 2\". one time she said this, one of our friend even pointed out \"but she (as in me) came first?\" and she didn't really react to that.  \nI talked about this to one of the girls in my group but I think she feels the issue is generally \"resolved\" or smt bc she doesn't point out her behavior to me anymore. I even talked about it to my therapist and she just told me to focus on my studies despite the fact that I was lwk just bawling my eyes out. She also told me that this is all normal and it just feels worst because of my childhood experiences. I guess I came here to get validation. Maybe advice, maybe some comforting bc I literally don't have anyone else irl to turn to.   \nkay thanks for reading pookie",

I’ve had a relationship with my ex for 4 Years give or take so we’ve dated and known each other for a long time . Our relationship wasn’t the best , it was toxic and honestly we argued alot and broke up many many times . But deep down we both could agree we really did love each other . In 2023 we both broke up and that was our longest break up period yet and at that time i was focusing on my intern and i didn’t really know what she was doing . Fast forward prolly a year after but eventually we did get back together but as you can tell we eventually broke up again too lol . Now this year we both found other people and lowkey i thought that’s how it’ll end but as it goes clearly not . We both got broken up and were single again but during that time we both actually had a proper talk one on one just realising how we both felt and she told me she apparently had a fwb after me and her broke up in 2023 . Which obviously shocked me cause she got back tgt with me without disclosing this information too me . And what confused me more was the fact she said she wanted me to be the one to comfort her which even made me feel more guilty but yea . She also told me that her nudes and stuff she did with the fwb got leaked and that’s the part i wanna get at . Just yesterday when i was working in my office , a friend of mine came to me and showed me a mega album with a bunch of leaks and it had her there . I saw the shit she did and for once in my life i really don’t know what to do . I know me and her aren’t even together but this past few months we connected again and since she just broke up so me and her started hanging out and doing what couples do . Me being stupid i realise it felt i was being used like another fwb . But it just hurts seeing that and knowing that the one girl i thought loved me so much did all this . It’s hard to come to terms with everything and im feeling like a mess . I don’t know if i can love again or trust again or what to feel . Part of me wants to feel bad cause her stuff got leaked but at the same time idk if she’s even taking accountability for what she did . I’m sorry if this is all very messy and hard to understand but i’m just really traumatised and i feel lost for the first time . ",

That's so insanely true. \n\nContext: we both work from home.\nMy partner when he is stressed or having a bad day at work, I just wouldn't want to be anywhere near him; because it would get me so annoyed & sometimes even mad. For instance he would mumble \"fuck me\"\"fuck\"\"man\" and things like that when I'm next to him, even though i know the words are not directed towards me, I still am super bothered by it.\n\nAlso he would say things like \"whys it happening to me, fml\" and i will find that super whiny.. I wanted to be a comforting girlfriend who go through all the thick and thin tgt, but frankly I just wanna leave him alone when his energy field is affecting mine.\n\nThe last few days been very very bad cos he's super stressed out over work, but i know i shouldn't lose my cool, he's already edgy, if I somehow add fuel to the fire it won't end well for us both.\n\nMy questions are: How should I approach this? Is there meditation that could help me become a more comforting gf? Or just being less bothered by this situation.\n\nGood thing is that I planned a solo trip in a few days yay.",

Love the deck besides that..\n\nFinally the true hero of my story and one maybe you wouldnt expect but my boy donphan/ramp took me on my final ride to masters. I think the extra padding of hp on don + 1 energy to hit right away was helpful in starting 1st. Ramp only helped me maybe 30% of the time but when he did he always sealed the battle.\n\nMy biggest enemy was Mars. Mars probably caught me more losses then I should have...\n\nAnyway wouldnt mind advice to tune the donny deck further. Dont know if ill ever do that sweaty grind again lol.",

Users, upon signing into Finviz, are welcomed by a dashboard that provides a snapshot of the day's market trends, top-performing stocks, recent news, and significant insider trading actions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Finviz Application Availability:**\n\nCurrently, Finviz does not offer an application for download from either the Android Play Store or the Apple Store. It is advised to access Finviz through conventional web browsers on computers or tablets.\n\n People might mistakenly install the FINWIZ app, but it is not the same company. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Insights into Finviz Heatmaps:**\n\nFinviz's heatmaps offer a dynamic visualization of the US and global stock market performances, pinpointing potential trading opportunities. The platform's ability to compile and display a comprehensive heatmap with such rapidity is noteworthy.

Nonetheless, Finviz stands out by allowing screenings based on candlestick and chart patterns, catering to both investors and traders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wcr435x9r6zb1.jpg?width=1273&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e25c16c31a965de1d9cb606aa9cb96c393548914\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Analysis of Finviz Charting:**\n\nFinviz provides essential daily chart pattern recognition and a select number of overlays and indicators, differentiating it from platforms like MetaStock and TradingView. The inclusion of automatic trendline detection and pattern identification offers significant advantages for traders focused on patterns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Enhancements in Finviz Elite Charting:**\n\nThe continuous development of Finviz Elite has resulted in notable improvements to interactive charting, including the addition of Heiken Ashi charts and more indicators and overlays. The new auto-save feature for charts and annotations further enhances the user experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/alyszlpcr6zb1.jpg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d40e73209dbfce747ef92d7ee3b770532132590c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Guide to Building Backtests in Finviz:**\n\nFinviz's backtester is a powerful tool with over 100 indicators, offering automated chart pattern recognition to aid in creating distinctive trading systems. An example of its effectiveness is a system that outperformed the S&P 500 over a 25-year period, utilizing the Price Rate of Change indicator.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tips for Stock Discovery Using Finviz:**\n\nTo identify potential breakout stocks, users can apply specific screener filters like \"Price crossed MA50 above\" and \"Gap Up 5%.\" \n\nFor locating potential short-squeeze candidates, filters like \"Float Short Over 30%\" and \"Option/Short - Optionable\" are useful. \n\nHowever, Finviz does not directly offer tools for finding undervalued stocks; for such a feature, platforms like Stock Rover are recommended, which provide detailed criteria including Fair Value and Margin of Safety for value-seeking investors.",

I've tried, but nothing I turn up, turn down, or turn off seems to help. I'm sure it doesn't help that there is no T598 profile in game (defaults to a TGT), and not likely to be one now that Codies has gone the way of the Dodo bird. \n\nDoes anyone with a T598 have some settings that work? Also, as I understand it, there is no way currently to have presets in the wheel for individual games. Is that correct? \n\nAny help or ideas will be very much appreciated. Thank you. ",

I would like to block off this section so my partner can watch her movies or whatnot in peace. I don't have speakers and always put a headset on. However, I'm not sure what the best way to do this is.\n\nI've looked at various acoustic panels, curtains, and dividers but I'm not sure what would be the best, most cost efficient solution without actually just building a whole new insulated wall in between.

And this year his brother is getting a much needed phone upgrade as his case is literally crumbling (a refurbished iPhone 14 -swappa). Yes, I like to get my Christmas done before Thanksgiving.\n\nI have been going thru threads here and getting chatgpt to help me try and figure out laptop abbreviations and specs.\n\nMy budget is far below $1,000, below $800 for sure, would like under $700. I am looking for a unit that will last him until he gets a job and can save and get whatever laptop he wants.\n\nThese have been the two I have been eyeing\n\nThe Best Buy Lenovo LOQ at $550\nLenovo - LOQ 15.6\" Full HD Gaming Laptop - AMD Ryzen 5 7235HS - 12GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 - 512GB SSD - Luna Grey\n*cons I have read is that the processor is already \"out of date\" despite being a 2025 designation- which i dont really understand \n\n\n*cons the return policy is 15 days, which worries me if there is issue since it is for Christmas well beyond. The seasonal return starts 11/1, but i dont know how long this will be at this price point\n\n*pro I have read the upgrade to ram and ssd is fairly easy for him to do \n\nThe walmart HP Victus at $599\nHP Victus 15.6 inch FHD 144Hz IPS Windows Gaming Laptop Intel Core i5-13420H 16GB RAM 512GB SSD RTX 4050 Mica Silver\n\n*cons I have read the intel processor is not as good as ryzen, but again I may be comparing apples to oranges instead of apple to apples, cause these words dont mean much to me\n\n*pro the seasonal return starts now\n\nI have seen lots of threads on the LOQ but not the Victus, so I am not sure if that is good or bad. \n\nI am sure either of these are light years ahead of his current laptop as it was a gap filler i did no attempt to understand but needed a nonchromebook unit for him.\n\nThank you all! \n\nI am also open to other recommendations. \n\nI do not live near a microcenter which appears to be a common suggestion.

I got the 368-members only email the day before and placed an order. The next day I was bombarded by retailers I follow with “in stock, ready to ship” offers.

I've been waiting for someone to point out what it actually means, but nobody has so here's my take on it.\n\n**EDIT** I just noticed u/nascompares posted about it 2 days ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/synology/comments/1o17ztb/dsm_73_nonverified_hdds_still_unsupported_on_rs/).\n\nDSM 7.3 is a good update for x25 plus owners (current and future) but it's a slap in the face for existing owners of RS Plus and DVA/NVR series and especially FS, HD, SA, UC, XS+, XS, and DP series owners.\n\n1. DSM 7.3 has **added** restrictions on any drive \"on the incompatibility list\" for **all** NAS models.\n2. DSM 7.3 has **added** the hated \"x25 plus series\" restrictions to RS Plus and DVA/NVR series.\n3. DSM 7.3 has **added** the hated \"x25 plus series\" restrictions **and** restrictions on SATA SSDs to FS, HD, SA, UC, XS+, XS, and DP series.\n4. DSM 7.3 has **removed** the hated \"x25 plus series\" restrictions (except for NVMe cache creation) for x25 plus series.\n5. DSM 7.3 hasn't changed anything for Value and J series (apart from point 1).\n\nIt's like Synology thought they'd appease the x25 plus owners, while sneaking in the hated restrictions for existing RS Plus, DVA/NVR, FS, HD, SA, UC, XS+, XS, and DP series.\n\nSomeone actually told me months ago that points 2 and 3 was coming before the end of this year.",

Sometimes **there are lines**, sometimes bright white lines, sometimes dim lines, and sometimes red lines appear as well.  \nSometimes in the lower center (near the frame with the Omen logo) there is also flickering, but the pattern is slightly different (like the screen is being pressed?).\n\nI tried it on an external monitor via HDMI and there were **no issues** on the **second display**, so it might not be a graphics-related problem (at least that's my preliminary conclusion).\n\nI've tried various modes, from **hybrid to discrete**, but the flickering problem **still occurs** (although I think it happens more often in hybrid mode). However, in both modes, there is no problem at all when using a second monitor (it only happens on the main screen).  \nSwitch from **144Hz to 60Hz**? I've already tried that, but the result is **still the same**. The flicker hasn't gone away.\n\nGo to the **service center**? Well, they **refused** me, saying that my device was **not officially** distributed in my country (it was imported). I asked them about my problem, but they just gave me the template answer that it had to be checked first. I asked for the part code for the screen, but they wouldn't give me the answer. It was disappointing.\n\nDoes anyone know where the problem might be?

Now we don't have even have basic option to move a file without copying and pasting unless I learn how computer science and make an automation. The basics like MOVING A FILE should not be this difficult. Literally Apple. Get it together. These MacBooks are not what they once were. I spend more time trying to figure out how to do basic functions like moving files or converting a multi page pdf to images. This is ridiculous. \n\n\n\nI've been searching for the answer/solution since I got the latest MacBook Air M2 nearly two years ago. All of my files are lost, disorganized and across multiple folders with the same name. I have been using MacBook since 2009 and I've never been so burdened on its functionality until this M2. What gives???? \n\n  \nApple. Why don't you include BASIC QUICK ACTIONS / AUTOMATIONS internally??? I have spent HOURS trying to make an automation. I have read all of the other posts of people with the same questions, and ppl responding with no accurate solution.  The closest solution is to make quick action to move a file but then you must chose ONE catch all folder. Thats not helpful. I need a right click menu with a drop down of all folders. \n\n\n\nFor example, I come across a file I had scanned months ago and it was lost in downloads. Now I want to move it quickly to \"Folder B.\" Folder B is not on my screen so I can not drag and drop. I cannot copy and paste without first finding Folder B in another finder window, then drag/drop or copy/paste. Does anyone else see how much time and focus this takes away or is it just me and my AudHD??",

I can do the \"Patrick\" voice easily and I can kind of do the \"Spongebob/Gnome\" voice and I can tell how the voice becomes gradually more feminine when combining the two, there's still obvious room for improvement there but I think the issue is my pitch is way too low, I can get it into a kind of feminine range but it definitely ends up causing a lot of strain and even that it still lower than I would ideally like, it also really limits my ability to do the light weight/\"Spongebob voice\" effectively. At best I can sound like, well, a post-puberty Spongebob kind of. How do I fix that?  \nI don't have a crazy deep like, James Earl Jones voice or anything but it's definitely solidly bass-y, the highest note I can hit when signing before my voice breaks is only around A3/G3 (with considerable effort to stay just under the break) and C3 is the highest I can get without straining.\n\nI know  \"deeper voices can still be feminine\" and all that and I'll take it if that's what I can get but I would really like to have a much higher pitch, not anime voice or anything but just something that feels more \"girly\" or at least isn't at the absolute bottom end. Is this possible for me or should I just give up on that dream and just aim for having a deep feminine voice? I know  I can train to talk at A3 with less strain but can you actually train that break point to be higher up or just not exist? I've seen a lot of conflicting information. And if I can't do that, how do I fix weight without being able to get a higher pitch?\n\nFor reference my default speaking voice  \n[https://voca.ro/1dsVdv3MKVnB](https://voca.ro/1dsVdv3MKVnB)  \nand best attempt after 3 days  \n[https://voca.ro/1aiw5tXJS4gs](https://voca.ro/1aiw5tXJS4gs)  \n(still bad of course but I think the bit where I say \"world\" is pretty good)  \n",

Another has weird duplication levels.\nYou check FastQC, scratch your head, and wonder if the sequencer had a bad day.\n\nThen comes alignment — your reads finally find a home in the reference genome. You feel relief… until you realize the BAM file is 80 GB and your disk just gave up.\n\nBut amidst all the chaos, there’s beauty.\nWhen you finally visualize the coverage, see a clear peak in a promoter region, or identify that single variant linked to a phenotype — you remember why you do this.\n\nNGS analysis teaches patience.\nIt humbles you.\nIt reminds you that every command, every script, every pipeline you run — it all contributes to uncovering stories hidden in the data.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, when you see that clean VCF, or a heatmap that actually makes biological sense, it’s not just analysis — it’s satisfaction.\n\nBecause NGS isn’t just next-generation sequencing.\nIt’s next-generation storytelling — written in ATCG.\n\nWhat’s the most frustrating or satisfying part of NGS analysis for you?

I am not sure when it's something medical or crazy my self out - or both. Please tell me I am not a lone and any guidance on this. I don't have a therapist or a psychiatrist. A family doctor I been seeing for years has been prescribing this. I am also in 5mg adderal and Xanax when I get in a panic attack which I really want to live without Xanax and maybe even without sertraline.

For instance, I will concentrate and issue a command for it to move right, and without exception, they will move right. Then I will command it to move left, up, and down, and it will move left, up, and down the moment I issue the aforementioned commands.\n\nI discovered this “ability” or whatever you’d prefer to call it perhaps 7 or 8 years ago. I would estimate that I have done this with about a hundred different UAP/orbs. I haven’t ever told anyone about this until now, because I figured nobody would be interested and that nobody in their right mind would believe me.\n\nIn addition to the UAP/orbs with which I believe I am interacting with, I have seen about half a dozen truly bizarre and inexplicable events involving larger objects much closer to me. \n\nUnfortunately, I sustained a serious neurological injury which came on about 12 hours after an encounter during which a UAP was very close to me, and have what can best be described as a mild form of dementia, which is not progressive or worsening. \n\nMy long term memory is seriously impaired and I can’t remember lengthy periods of my life. My short term memory sucks sometimes and I’m unable to focus or concentrate in various situations. \n\nIt’s awful. Based on my symptoms, it appears that there may be damage to my prefrontal cortex, although this has never been confirmed by imaging. My physician took it seriously when I told her about six months ago and offered a referral to a neurologist, which I will be doing soon. \n\nIdeally, that neurologist will do an MRI. Dr. Garry Nolan has described specific structural abnormalities seen in people who were injured and experience almost identical symptoms immediately after a UAP sighting that was in close proximity to them.\n\nI had a video of the object which I believed caused my injury, but said video has disappeared from the iPad I originally took the video on, the Mac which I uploaded it to, and both memory sticks I used to back it up. \n\nI have no idea how to explain the disappearance of that video and can’t even fathom how it disappeared from four separate places simultaneously.\n\nThat night, which I believe was in 2013 or 2014, I had a sudden inexplicable urge to go outside and down to the street at approximately 2AM. It was like I was being summoned, and it is not possible to further explain that feeling and my compulsion to go outside with my iPad using words alone.\n\nThat same feeling of being compelled to go to a certain place only to discover a UAP “waiting for me” for lack of better terminology perhaps four or five more times in my life. The last time I recall this happening was in 2018, and I do have video footage which clearly shows a very bright UAP moving in an odd pattern. \n\nThis is one of two drawings I felt compelled to make shortly after one of the sightings. I have no idea what it means, but it appears to contain some form of letters or language:\n\n(see attached image)\n\nI don’t know what to do with my life. The injury was devastating. It has been suggested that I may have been exposed to some sort of damaging emission from whatever propulsion system the craft was using, but I find that to be pretty unlikely as highly intelligent NHI would be well aware that their propulsion system would injure humans.\n\nIf it came down to it, I’d testify about any of this stuff under oath, and I take oaths seriously as I believe in god although my concept of god differs from what most mainstream religions think. In fact, I would love to testify, but I’m well aware that I’ll never be given a chance to do so.\n\nUAPs seem to be attracted to me. I had an extraordinarily strange sighting outside my apartment with my wife and child in 2009 (I think? Maybe 2010) which left us in awe. We were so shocked to see this object, which looked like a tic tac, zipping around in the sky. We actually doubted what we saw, as it was a little after 9:30PM and we were all tired.\n\nOur sighting was validated quite significantly when two jets, which I believe were F/A 18s, flew in a direct intercept path with where we saw the object a little less than three minutes after we saw it. \n\nFull afterburner, roaring like crazy, just about 1,500-2,000 feet in the air. I have lived in an area surrounded by military bases all of my life and see jets and Ospreys flying over on a daily basis during exercises… But, never once has there been an exercise where jets using full afterburner at low altitude over a dense residential area. \n\nThe military avoids stuff like that due to the noise, but not that night. It was very, very clear that they were trying to intercept whatever it was that we saw. \n\nI submitted a sighting report and it was eventually posted on a permanent database which had about 15 other sightings that occurred over our city, but when I looked for it a few years later, it had been removed from the archive. \n\nAll of the other sightings remained untouched. I emailed site admin and they said that they would have never removed a sighting from the database, so it’s anybody’s guess how or why that happened.\n\nThis is but a small sample of the things I’ve seen. I feel like it’s relevant, based on what Ross Coulthart said about the CIA doing experiments on children who were in the GATE program, that I had a very high hit rate on Xener cards which resulted in several adults crowding around me and asking a bunch of questions. \n\nSame deal with another test where there were five lights of different colors on a panel with buttons in front of them. Soon as a light went on, I was supposed to push a button, and my response time was measured. \n\nI was accused of holding down the buttons before the test administrator activated the lights, which, in retrospect, seems like a possible indicator of precognition. Soon as I got a near-zero hit with the lights “game”, the administrator got visibly excited, sort of like how the other adults got when I had hits on 14 out of 20 Xener cards. (I previously thought it was 11/20 but recently recalled another test with the same cards where I got 14/20.\n\n\nAnyway, that’s enough rambling. I hope my story is of interest to some people, and that perhaps my bizarre experiences might help validate other people who are scared or hesitant to come forward because of how weird the encounter was and because they don’t want to be labeled as a UFO nut.\n\n\n\n",

Would it be around the value of a flaxen fade since theyre also a bit harder to find or is there no inherent value?

Tried a new Indian food place that afternoon with someone else. They did not get sick.\n\nDay 3 - Continued fever, chills. Noticed right sided lymph nodes near my right collarbone & right neck towards the back side. A few lymph nodes 2ish cm big.\n\nDay 4 - Night sweats drenched at night. GP examined my throat, ear, chest and said it's a viral URTI and to do supportive care. COVID test negative. Stated it's not mononucleosis due to normal throat.\n\nDay 5 - Continued fever, chills, night sweats. Slight puffy eyes on both sides, but very subtle. Made my eyelids look big, thought it was cosmetic.\n\nDay 6 - Took a nap, woke up with right sided puffy eye + surrounding eyelid. Went to emergency. Said low chance of being periorbitial cellulitis, but gave me Keflex that I've been taking since. Normal chest XRay and low white count (3.6) but otherwise normal CBC. He also believes it's still likely viral URTI.\n\nDay 7 - Slight puffy eye when waking, but improved. Continued fever, chills, night sweats. First day measuring night fever, at 38.4 then 37.5 after Tyenol\n\nDay 8 - No puffy eye when waking. No tylenol so far. Temperature 38.4 just now. I feel the sweats coming. Bowel movements daily have been very small even with Restorolax use.\n\nOtherwise healthy. New girlfriend last month who tested negative for STI.\n\nI've never been sick for more than 2-3 days in my life, and my fever doesn't seem to be improving nor my lymph nodes going down.

If I leave this relationship to pursue a better ones, would it be worth it if I didn't find another guy? and he definitely won't just be waiting around for me to come crawling back either.

I put a lot of work into creating fully functional, polished apps, but sometimes I see 1- or 2-star ratings come in with no comment at all.\n\nThese low ratings can really drag down the overall score, even if the vast majority of users are happy and the app works perfectly. I understand that 3–5 stars are subjective, but 1–2 stars usually indicate a real problem — yet right now Google Play doesn’t require users to leave any explanation.\n\nIt feels unfair, and it’s frustrating because there’s little recourse. Sure, you can flag reviews as inappropriate, but if it’s just a low rating without a comment, there’s rarely anything Google will remove.\n\nWouldn’t it make sense if Google Play required a short explanation when giving 1 or 2 stars? At least then we could understand the problem, respond appropriately, or flag truly inappropriate reviews.\n\nI’d love to hear from other devs — do you experience this too?

Existing email tools claim personalization, but most fall short—producing messages that recipients easily spot as bulk or automated.\n\n# What Makes It Different?\n\n* **Deeper personalization:** Each email features personalized lines based on real company research, the contact’s role, and industry context.\n* **AI-powered research:** No scraping—actual insights and up-to-date information per prospect.\n* **Configurable tone:** Users can set AI to sound empathetic, formal, friendly, etc., per campaign or recipient type.\n* **Rich workflow logic:** Automate multi-stage campaigns with conditional branches and delays.\n* **Easy data enrichment:** Integrate with apollo using BYOK and other sources for robust prospect info.\n\n# My Questions for You:\n\n* Do you struggle with bulk email fatigue or low response rates in your own outreach?\n* Would you value ultra-personalized emails with a human touch, even at scale?\n* What features or pain points would convince you to switch to this type of solution?\n* Have you tried similar tools? What was missing?\n\nDrop your thoughts, critiques, or wish-list ideas in the comments! Your feedback will help me validate (or pivot) this concept before building further.",

After the antibiotics i realized that small tiny itchy bumps were appearing all over my face. Got on tret, didn’t work. Upped the strength after 9 months, didn’t work. Tried damn near everything( clindamycin lotion, doxycycline, spiro, aklief, salicylic acid, lactic acid, metronidazole), didn’t work. Got extractions, nothing came out of most bumps . \n\nTook an intolerance test and my results came back with a HIGH level of Malassezia Furfur overgrowth in my gut, along with some other issues(low amounts of helpful bacteria strains) Apparently this can contribute to Malassezia Foliculitis. Needless to say, I will be switching derms to hopefully get a skin scrape + anti fungal prescription that will ACTUALLY work. My derm definitely dropped the ball—skin has consistently looked like this for 2 years no matter what I used 😒",

    "content": "I came around in morgan and adalees life when she was about a year and a half or two years old. so that would be April of 2022. ok so morgan and i had somewhat of an agreement when ian was conceived, his birthday is 04/24/23 so ian was conceived approximately July '22. i was doing restauraunt remodeling back then for niteowl construction/jared gruca. then i got into a fight at a wedding and morgan got ran over because she tried to intervene and ended up in the hospital this was may of '22 i believe. so two months go by and ian is conceived, which would make sense we were closet drinking at her parents back then when i worked at all construction, a low pay entry level gutter installation job. it grew into a decent paying job i was averaging 32$/hr at one point..then ian was born in 4/24/23 and i lost my job about 6 months later due to missing work and leaving due to the heavy load of a newborn and a 2 year old i had to help out at home more then my employer liked, so i got fired on 10/17/23. that year i worked at all construction i sent morgan over $20,000.00 over cashapp, if you want to dig im sure you could find proof, or if she was willing to state the truth you could ask her. so that would be 2023. 2024 i was employed by goodyear starting 10/30/23. i only had a 13 days of a gap of employment which i thought was good. it was a huge decrease in wages i started off at 19$/hr..i never quit providing for these kids at any point yet i was adamant about being in their life still and we haven't even got to the apartment part yet.  okay so going into 2024 was extremely rough, we had signed a lease and we were moving in 12/15/2023 i believe. Thankfully i bought most of the things we needed long in advance when i was with allconstruction and paid for the deposit/first month well beforehand. we decided to keep pushing forwards as to rasising a newborn and 2 year old at her parents house didn't seem like a feasible option to me so we continued..at the time of move in i was in jail doing 3 days mandatory time for the OVI i got that night morgan got ran over as well..i was out driving looking for her the police told me she was lifeflighted to the hospital and i was basically in panic mode..if you look into the recorded court session of my ovi i clearly stated i was taking care of a child that was not mine at the time and i explained my situation to the judge. since then i have provided for a family of 4, on a yearly wage of approximately 32,000$ while morgan was supposed to be the stay at home mom while ian was a newborn. she never found a concrete job and just left me drowning financially for the whole time we had the apartment basically. i was borrowing money off family to pay rent, my brother has paid our rent once, my dad has helped pay multiple times, and her parents have helped multiple times as well. we made it through two leases with the company, one 12 month lease and one 18 month lease. she never really stepped up and offered help outside the home, and i voiced multiple times i needed help paying bills. im not gonna break it down for you here but 33k for a family of 4 is definitely tough and i had little to no bills personally, other then phone/insurance... so that explains 2024 and most of 2025. \n\n\n\n2025 we move out 9/1/25 into her parents.\n\n\n\nwe were fighting bad the past 6 months beforehand so i was extremely concerned about moving in there with her. she has always treated me relatively bad in a sense, she was controlling, suffered from real bad anxiety so i basically did all the shopping or anything that dealt with the outdoors, she just couldn't do it. at this point we have a 2 year old and a 5 year old.\n\n\n\nit's October and i think i cleared 28,000$ so far. i guess what im trying to say is i have been steadily providing for a toxic woman who has constantly belitted me and taken advantage of me, drug me through the mud, manipulated me, she may as well of been punching me in the face on a daily basis as to that would have been easier to deal with for me. she was freaking out on me one day and i just had enough of it all..i was replacing solenoids on my Pontiac and she came home and freaked out on me for working on the car and she said something about if i was there when she got back she'd call the cops. so i just packed my stuff up and left after that. i constantly felt pushed away and taken advantage of as she was full of double standards as well.\n\n\n\n3.5 years later\n\n\n\n$100,000.00 later\n\n\n\nNothing materialistic to show for it really.\n\nI lost two cars\n\nGained one nice car on a loan w/ neal\n\nGained two kids\n\nLost f\n\n\n\ni literally kinda just noticed how materialistic ive been and its scary so i just offered morgan 75% of the tax return and i keep 25%(obviously) she will probably say no to it but i am just trying to work through all the feelings im having here i feel offended at her offers half of the time because she has held no financial responsibilities for the kids ive help raise the past 3.5 years but i love them kids i would do anything for them, and it's just money..",

    "content": "Hello everyone! I’m exploring a new AI-powered email outreach tool aimed at solving a major pain point in B2B lead generation and sales campaigns. Existing email tools claim personalization, but most fall short—producing messages that recipients easily spot as bulk or automated.\n\n# What Makes It Different?\n\n* **Deeper personalization:** Each email features personalized lines based on real company research, the contact’s role, and industry context.\n* **AI-powered research:** No scraping—actual insights and up-to-date information per prospect.\n* **Configurable tone:** Users can set AI to sound empathetic, formal, friendly, etc., per campaign or recipient type.\n* **Rich workflow logic:** Automate multi-stage campaigns with conditional branches and delays.\n* **Easy data enrichment:** Integrate with apollo using BYOK and other sources for robust prospect info.\n\n# My Questions for You:\n\n* Do you struggle with bulk email fatigue or low response rates in your own outreach?\n* Would you value ultra-personalized emails with a human touch, even at scale?\n* What features or pain points would convince you to switch to this type of solution?\n* Have you tried similar tools? What was missing?\n\nDrop your thoughts, critiques, or wish-list ideas in the comments! Your feedback will help me validate (or pivot) this concept before building further.",

Looking for some guidance for those who are also a few years postop or those who just have any advice. \n\nI will be 3 years post op next week (crazy!) and I have lost a total of 160lbs. In these three years I have definitely struggled mentally with disordered eating, obsession, and the highs and lows that come with weight loss. I had loose skin removal, and for the first time in my life I’m somewhat confident in my body. In August, I went to Europe for a month and gained 5lbs. I know in the grand scheme of things, I should not be obsessing over 5 pounds. The issue is I am HUNGRY. I feel like something has switched, and I am really struggling to maintain being in a deficit to lose these 5 pounds.\n\nI am so worried that 5 pounds will turn into 15 pounds and so on. I am eating my protein, trying to get in my water, but the food noise is real. I’m so paranoid I will be a failure and be one of the stories of people who gain weight back after a few years. I’m ranting at this point, but the fear is real and I am spiritually lol",

They wait until you go in the opposite direction to send you an order to a restaurant you just passed and it’s ready when you get there. They withhold how much the pay of the order is until you deliver to make it seem like it will be a big increase, when in reality, it’s an extra 25 cents. They allow customers that lives 15 miles away to order without tipping or low tipping and if you refuse to take it, your rating drops and it takes forever to get it back to good standing. If you make good money one week, they will send you lowball offers for two weeks in a row and leave you frustrated and pissed off as a platinum dasher. They lie about you being “idle” and will unassign you and bring down your completion rating. They want you to take orders worth $2 or $3 for 6+ miles. Then the customer gets upset that their food is cold, knowing good and well it’s their fault that they didn’t get their food. I had to vent here since it’s cheaper than getting a therapist.",

The company, formerly known as Connexa Sports Technologies, has rebranded as AiRWA Inc. and is positioning itself in the fast-growing space of AI, tokenized finance, and digital asset infrastructure. They’ve already made headlines for receiving **$30 million in Solana tokens** to integrate into their upcoming tokenized equities and exchange platform, showing early traction in a sector that could explode with renewed crypto market momentum.\n\nAiRWA’s reported financials actually paint a surprisingly solid picture for a microcap. The company has shown roughly $12.5 million in annual revenue, a gross profit of $9.5 million, and even net earnings of about $2.3 million, giving it a low P/E ratio that suggests serious undervaluation. With a tiny market cap of only a few million dollars, the market seems to be pricing in failure, which also means that any hint of positive momentum could send the price soaring.\n\nAt its current level, YYAI offers what some traders see as “asymmetric upside.” The downside risk is limited. The stock has already absorbed months of decline, but the potential reward is massive if the company gains traction in its blockchain or AI ventures. Their foray into tokenized trading, combined with the growing global interest in **DeFi and digital exchanges**, positions AiRWA perfectly to capitalize if the next crypto bull cycle hits.\n\nYYAI sits at the intersection of **AI and blockchain**, both industries set for major growth. It’s a beaten-down microcap that can't get any lower. If even a fraction of its plans materialize, a stock this small and this cheap could easily become one of those “wish I bought at $0.20” stories.",

    "content": "Prairie Operating Co (PROP) is an energy company engaged in the development and acquisition of oil and natural gas resources in the United States. \n\ntldr; PROP has an extremely low valuation because of dilution risk from selling preferred shares to fund a 600m acquisition. They have 2.4b in oil reserves. Hedges 85% of their production to be able to sell barrels at $66 up to 2028. Revenue has blown up to 70m last quarter and with a new RBL re-rating PROP will have enough money to pay off the preferred shares eliminating dilution risk. Insiders own 30% - 50% of the company and they will not let the shares be diluted on March 2026.\n\n---\n\nPROP is excellent at acquisitions and buys them at 2 to 2.5 multiples. They are always looking for deals. And competitors are paying a 4 or more multiple on acquisitions.\n\nBiggest risks with PROP are Series F redemptions and management not executing. Series F preferred stock being redeemed into common shares will dilute shareholders badly but management will use their credit facilities and cash flow to pay off Series F holders in cash.\n\nPROP sold preferred shares and warrants to fund a 600m acquisition of assets in DJ basin from Baywater. PROP had a market cap of 200m before the acquisition but is valued at 100m today. Oil exposure is well hedged through early 2028 so there is no commodity pricing risk.\n\nManagement wouldn’t let PROP holdings be diluted as insiders own 30% - 50% of the company. The Co-founders and executive team are very large equity shareholders. PROP has publicly stated that they are working towards eliminating the dilution overhang associated with the preferred stock.\n\nSeries F holders may convert all or a portion of their shares of Series F Preferred Stock into shares of our Common Stock at any time but they wouldn’t do that as they are collecting a 12% dividend for holding preferred shares. They also wouldn’t dare to do an ATM at this dogshit valuation.\n\nPROP has access to borrow a maximum of 475m from a Reserve-Based Lending (RBL) Credit Facility. They currently are borrowing 386m which helped fund the Baywater assets acquisition. They also owe 185m to Series F holders.\n\nSeries F will need to be paid off all at once to prevent massive shareholder dilution. With a new evaluation coming in the next month or two, PROP should be able to borrow more than 85m from RBL and they can borrow the rest from the high yield debt market. They will be able to get a loan with all the assets they have including 2.4b in oil reserves.\n\nAI is driving really profound growth in data centers and all that electricity is predominantly being generated by fossil fuels. So there is still demand for oil and gas. The oil and gas industry is not dying.\n\nPROP revenue is up 400% reaching 68.1m in Q2 2025.\nProduction is up 540% reaching over 21,000 barrels of oil per day. PROP's goal is to get to about 100,000 barrels a day. They produce on average about 25,000 barrels of oil per day so far. By the end of 2025 with their 600m acquisition the output should be much higher.\n\nThey have hedges covering 85% of PDP production for 2025 through 2028 for an average price of $66 a barrel. If they reach their goal of 100k barrels a day that is 2.4b in annual revenue.\n\nPROP will spend 300m a year on capex. In 2026, the cash flow that they generate is going to exceed that capex. PROP’s will do dividends or buybacks in the future after they deleverage and pay down debt. Their goal is to return value to their shareholders and keep leverage lowering than the competition.\n\n\n----\n\nHere are hard TTM numbers for PROP and two competitors.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/CoBCF5v\n\nAs you can see REI looks great compared to PROP. But PROP revenue is ramping up. It hit almost 70m in Q2. Earnings for Q3 are coming out soon and it should be higher. PROP will easily earn 400m annually. The preferred shares will be redeemed in March 2026 but I see PROP easily eliminating them and the dilution problem before then. It’s in the best interest of management who have significant stakes and will gain tens or hundreds of millions of dollars if they continue to execute well.\n\n----\n\nPrairie Operating Co. was co-founded by Gary C. Hanna and Edward Kovalik, who currently serve as President and Chairman/CEO, respectively.\n\nAs of October 2025, Prairie Operating Co. (NASDAQ: PROP) has 50.28 million common shares outstanding\n\n\nBoard of Directors / Management / Co-founders owned at least 6,303,082 shares. I did not go through all the sec filings to find the rest. If the Series F shares are redeemed. Not only do the insiders lose millions they also would fail to gain the hundreds of millions that they would have gained from eliminating the dilution risk. There is a very very high chance the Series F preferred shares will not be redeemed. Insiders like Jonathan H. Gray has recently bought shares as recently as this September.\n\n\n\nName | Shares Owned\n---|---\n Edward Kovalik | 2,037,035\n Gary C. Hanna | 2,038,206\nJonathan H. Gray | 1,065,975\nGregory Scott Patton  | 798,519\nRichard N. Frommer  | 129,872\nErik Thoresen   | 120,760\nStephen Lee | 112,715\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Qgf9hF1\nhttps://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PROP&p=d\n\nIf these numbers are accurate. Insiders own 30% - 50% of the company. There's no way in hell they will let themselves be diluted into oblivion.",

    "content": "Hello fellow Ally gamers!\n\nI was hoping to show off my new mechanical mount for the Ally X. I have fallen in love with handhelds over the years and went from the SteamDeck to the Legion Go to the Ally and now the Ally X (Xbox Ally X on order).\n\nPartly as a business and partly to enjoy connecting with other people that enjoy the handheld space I have been designing and building out my MechLock line-up and recently completed testing on the Ally X MechLock:\n\n  \nTake a look here for more information:\n\n[designmakeship.com](https://www.designmakeship.com/) or [etsy.designmakeship.com](http://etsy.designmakeship.com)\n\n(Also play around with the customizer/personalizer on the website, my wife set it all up and it is really slick)\n\nI am very excited about the design on this MechLock specifically. All of the MechLock line uses a gearing system with a motion ratio to utilize the system's own weight to hold secure it in place. The lower rack drives the upper rack at a 2:1 ratio causing the upper rack to move twice as fast as the lower rack. Thus as the lower rack moves down from the weight of the system, the upper rack comes down faster until it contacts the top of the Ally X. The more the system pulls down the tighter the lock becomes. Then when you lift up on the Ally X a spring returns the lower rack and the upper rack moves away from the system faster unlocking the entire system.\n\nNow! What makes the Ally X eXtra (ugh) exciting for me? Plugging in the USB using the system described above is easy. Unplugging it is the real issue. Those pesky USB ports have a lot more stiction (initial static friction) than you'd think. On the Ally X, I designed an additional gearing system that uses a 3:1 ratio to gain mechanical advantage at two \"pusher\" racks that push the Ally X away from the USB plug as you lift up on the Ally X. Look carefully at the upper rack in the video and you can see the system at work. \n\nI'll be around for a while to answer any questions so please let them rip. I am an engineer so I love talking on the technical details but I will be happy to answer anything else.\n\nIf you have made it this far then you rock eXtra! Thanks for looking!\n\n\\-Dylan\n\np.s. Apologies for the video effects, I am trying to get better at it.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n",

I’ve been creating these **handmade, handwritten calligraphy scrolls**, and I just finished one inspired by *Taylor Swift’s “The Fate of Ophelia.”* 💌\n\nEach scroll is made from aged parchment-style paper, written completely by hand, and sealed with a wax stamp. You can personalize it with your **own name, word, or short poem**, and I’ll turn it into a **custom acrostic calligraphy piece**.\n\nI’ve always loved blending poetry, vintage aesthetics, and a touch of witchy magic — so these scrolls have become my favorite project lately. 🌙\n\nIf you’d like to see more or order one for yourself, here’s my shop link: [https://lavslunaarts.etsy.com](https://lavslunaarts.etsy.com)\n\nWould love to know what kinds of words or lyrics you’d love to see turned into scrolls next! 🕯️💫",

They will be available to purchase for everyone except my US buyers (I'll get to ya'll in a moment.) Please note that to keep within the rules set by the company, only a limited amount of prints will be available (100 max). Each print is limited edition. \n\nIn order to keep the prints affordable while still paying myself for the incredible amount of labour to produce them ($1 an hour artist wage life haha), each print takes quite a while to get scanned by my trusted guy and printed via a website, the turn around for them sits around 3 weeks.\n\nBASICALLY, as soon as I have my first batch of prints, I will be putting them up on Etsy to purchase for now. This will be available to everyone in the world except for the US to purchase immediately.\n\nIf you are in the US: In hopefully the next 1-2 weeks all 4 artworks (I am working on one now) will be available for PREORDER as I am getting them produced and distributed from inside the US (saves the huge import fees). I'm sorry for how long this process will take for you but once again it's the only way I can pull it off without having to charge a billion dollars just to get them to you :) I appreciate your patience and if you are interested in getting any of the artworks and want to be notified when they are ready for ordering, swing me a DM and I can make a note of you! \n\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF MY ART! In the age of AI it makes me sad to see the loss of heart and soul in art but I'm determined to fight the good fight against it and thanks to ya'll it's possible. :) :)",

My Google Chrome doesn't have my old address as I only started to use it after I moved to my new address. Yes, I checked to make double sure my old address had not somehow loaded up on Google Chrome. I've approached the human customer service representatives at Etsy several times, they've not been helpful, and by the tone of their communication, they clearly don't want to be bothered.

    "content": "Hello everyone! I’m now back to posting on this sub. \n\n“This paper describes the development of two of the most important scientific disciplines in the last quarter of the 20th century,\ncognitive science, which emerged in 1975, and nano-bio-info-cogno (NBIC) converging technologies, which emerged in 2000. In\nthis century, we will achieve cross-disciplinary integration, innovation in comprehensive knowledge and comprehensive devel-\nopment in human resources. NBIC converging technologies will greatly expand human cognition and communication, improve\nhuman health, enhance social outcomes, strengthen national security and unify science and education. Cognitive science and con-\nverging technologies will have major effects on the future human development. I argue that the 21st century represents an age of\nsynthesis, reflected in the continual reintegration between scientific disciplines in recent times. This new age of synthesis will\nrequire innovations in thought and methodology that differ from those underlying the age of analysis in the 20th century. I predict that these developments will allow every individual to realize comprehensive development. Accordingly, the education system will be transformed, and a comprehensive human resources system will be created.”\n\n“In 2000, a research program sponsored by a NSF grant awarded to the World Technology Evaluation Center (WTEC) sought to identify the leading fields of science in the new century. Over 70 outstanding scientists took part in the program. The consensus that emerged identified the importance of nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science, leading to the combination of these fields into a new discipline referred to as NBIC converging technologies.\n\nThis development heralded a new era of scientific development in the 21st century, focused on the integration of\nnumerous disciplines in science and technology. The 21st century thus constitutes an \"age of synthesis\".”\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11434-010-4005-7\n\nhttps://scispace.com/pdf/the-age-of-synthesis-from-cognitive-science-to-converging-4fhww8fu04.pdf\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/225946384_The_age_of_Synthesis_From_cognitive_science_to_converging_technologies_and_hereafter",

Plenty of pics during those other times spent, photos with them and of them, before this perticular one, and a few after this one, including a float trip.

So you guys might know Chu (this degenerate: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTj\\_hlsdKs-gLqoEB31IeZg)\n\nBasically, around a year ago, I started messaging him on email, just some random stupid shit, and all of a sudden, I get an email from him stating \"Burn in hell faggot\"\n\nFollowed By \"Fucking retarded autistic bitch. Sending dumb ass disses to your principle and repeating grades in school. Stop messaging me fag\"\n\nFor the one above, I basically told him I was gonna make a diss on my principle lol.\n\nOh also this \"How did the dis to your principal go, you fucking retard?\"\n\nAnd This \"Sorry. I just had to let you know how I feel about you one time. You’re such a piece of shit tbh. So that’s what you get. And I’m gonna remove you from my email list because you’re garbage. I don’t wanna send you anything anymore. But you can keep harassing me like a weirdo if you want by emailing daily about rap disses to your school teachers smh.\"\n\nI have no idea why he did this, but for everyone thinking this is staged and fake, here you go: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5fbs0r1x5uf1.png?width=2276&format=png&auto=webp&s=26be229050de81b586c7f7451c943a8b09d4f6c5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/caf0l0r1x5uf1.png?width=2256&format=png&auto=webp&s=d76dbe1dc656a73a87ae918d9a9d904b9c0a9dce\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7sf11r1x5uf1.png?width=2266&format=png&auto=webp&s=a17b53c75b12fe1fd5e0940bd760b02856fbcb2a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r1lv40r1x5uf1.png?width=2252&format=png&auto=webp&s=3681bc8462e7d7ace30fd5b77463661a08c3e02d\n\n\n\nNow the only reason I would imagine him saying this is because I emailed him one day basically saying \"Get Ratioed Bozo\", But I don't think I said anything that bad, idk.\n\n  \nI got into a car accident a while back, and basically I replied to one of his emails basically saying something along the lines of \"Hey I got into a car accident, please pray for me\", Or some shit like that, Yeah I don't know why I felt the need to email him that I got into an accident, but whatever. Anyways, Read this for yourself:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dv4mvf6tx5uf1.png?width=2266&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a0245b3ef4e4b8571f601cf57564c1ec20cdfce\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f8h57g6tx5uf1.png?width=2278&format=png&auto=webp&s=18b6f6b2a64cf7978d00552b578feff424cfa10d\n\n[this one is kinda funny lol](https://preview.redd.it/yvlpeg6tx5uf1.png?width=2266&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9c6d3a9c355ace297816825927b27b48963407d)\n\nNow, For anyone asking why I felt the need to \"expose\" him now, after all this time.\n\nI just hate this guy, and I hate the fact that he can do this to me and so many other people, and STILL have a platform to make money off of.\n\nI also did try to expose him a while back on twitter, but the post never got attention: [https://x.com/CLEAN\\_ON\\_YT/status/1813061773139771412](https://x.com/CLEAN_ON_YT/status/1813061773139771412)\n\nPS: If my account gets banned/deleted, its because reddit thinks I'm trying to go against their \"ban evasion\" policies lol.",

As that information diffuses, incremental buyers plus any small European KPI drop can push this thin order book fast.

NASDAQ: MYNZ has already reclaimed the $1.60 pivot on the 15-min and is basing above VWAP.

If $1.60 holds through the close and in pre-market, do we get a clean shot at filling the upper fair-value gap next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nAMBI TSLA QS MIGI WMT TCRT PLTR BCG SLGL AREC WDC CLIR RVSN ASTS DEVS SPHL PMEC UNH SKYE HKPD SRPT TJX SHFS IPSC HOOD QTTB DGNX ANET DKNG HIT VIVK NFLX PANW SFHG BENF AVGO PC TRX GSIT GEV GILD CRVO FIG LLY CLYM CRCL SNWV V GLBZ INDP COCH SPRB VYNE BE IQST DELL NXXT LINK FBLG TELO MSPR META POET MTEN SCWO F FLUT LXEO XBIO SOPA IBM RITR KLAC TOVX ASNS CLRB CHR ELAB BNAI GS TDDT PFE CRDO TNMG VRT HOWL PCSA LCFY BMNR FOFO DHI CRWD ELPW PM MSN NITO BAOS CLIK DRCT YDKG LBGJ DDC BJDX SHMD MA GLTO MARA BKNG UAMY POLA",

    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nYesterday was wild for this stock. We saw a huge dip, then a massive 28% bounce back. I grabbed 1,500 shares near the bottom at $1.37 and I'm holding.\n\nI think this could easily push back up to the old range around $1.71-$1.75. That would be a nice quick swing trade.\n\nWhy the sudden confidence? Check the recent news! This company, Mainz Biomed (MYNZ), has been racking up wins in Europe.\n\n* They just launched their main cancer test in Switzerland (Sept 23, 2025). That means real money coming in from a new country now, not later.\n* They also got regulatory approval to sell in the U.K. (Sept 2, 2025) a huge market.\n* Plus, they locked in the timeline for their next-gen test data (Q4 2025) which is key for their path to the U.S. FDA.\n\nIt looks like the fundamentals are getting stronger right as the price is trying to recover.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is this just a dead cat bounce, or does the recent news give it the fuel to keep climbing?\n\n  \nJZXN RKT WETH V ACHR ACN SHOP LBGJ RKLB SLGL BNAI MU MIGI PC MA JNJ SOFI WBX TMO RNAZ ULY EGAN NISN BKSY SDOT PG BRN APP MSFT QNCX DRCT BA RITR SGLY HOOD DKNG IONQ GOOG ENGS SRPT BKKT SOPA IREN LINK BMNR OPEN COIN AMAT BURU SLNH SHMD GS AMBI BGL SPRB FPAY IMXI HCWB LRCX DLXY VZ DSY ASTS NITO TJX AVTX TOVX AGRZ HKPD AKAN ANET POET CIIT NXL RKLB TXN PRHI MRVL CAT AVGO NFLX YDKG VYNE QTTB QMCO PMAX CHAI TSLA ",

    "content": "I’ve always struggled with over‑ear cans (think Sony 7506, etc.) pinching my ears and getting sweaty during longer practice. I finally tried a pair of IEMs — Tipsy M1 — and after a week of rehearsals I’m kind of sold.\n\nA few personal notes:\n\n* Comfort: I can wear them 2–3 hours without the ear pain/pressure I usually get from over-ears. Seal holds up even when I’m laying into the kick/hat.\n* Isolation: With foam tips I’m getting enough bleed reduction to keep click and tracks clear, but I can still hear some room/kit, which I like.\n* Detail: Because the nozzle sits closer to the ear canal, I’m hearing transient detail I missed on my 7506 — ghost notes and sample tails stand out more at the same SPL.\n* Practical: Lower stage volume and less sweat. Cable over-ear keeps them stable.\n\nSetup:\n\n* Running them from my interface’s headphone out with a limiter on the cue mix.\n* Best results so far with medium foam tips; silicone worked but the seal shifted when I got sweaty.\n\nQuestions for the drummers here:\n\n* Any long-term concerns with IEMs vs closed-back cans for practice?\n* Favorite tips or fit hacks for harder playing?\n* Do you prefer a small headphone amp/monitor pack for more headroom?\n* Other IEM recommendations in the same price bracket I should compare?",

    "content": "I have been into astrophotography for a while now - started with the DSLR and a tripod for nightsky landscapes. Then got my first Newtonian on EQ2 mount (mostly for visual observations, but managed to mount phone and, to an extent, a DSLR to it).\n\nThen got a proper beginner setup - ZWO AM3, Askar 71F and ASIAir Mini, which got me great detail up to 60 sec exposures (great for nebulae!). Then I got ASI120MM + WilliamOptics Uniguide 50mm autoguider and got into really long exposures (10 min per frame - even better for nebulae!). I recently tried dual narrow-band filters (Askar ColorDuo C1+C2) and sort of Hubble palette, so I was able to capture some faint nebulae (to a degree), like Triffid, Prawn, Cat's Paw, War and Peace, Dragons of Ara (with 16 hrs total exposure).\n\nNow I am thinking what should I upgrade next.\n\nOn one hand, I have a telescope - upgrading to a lightweight Newtonian suited for astrophotography - my 490 mm telescope allows me to frame large nebulae, but for something like Dumbbell or Helix nebula or even some galaxies - it is a bit too wide-field.\n\nOn the other hand, I am thinking about the camera - my Sony a7 III is good, but thermal noise and sensitivity are not the best for astrophoto. I wonder if a cooled OSC is a good option or should I try some entry-level mono camera with a set of filters (I don't think I would be able to meaningfully reuse my dual-band filters).\n\nBeing considerate of the costs - a Newtonian lightweight enought for AM3 (carbon GSO 6\") would set me off by approx. A$1200 (or A$1600 for 8\" version), whereas a comparable camera from ZWO (locked into their ecosystem with ASIAir and the mount) price-wise would be either ASI533MC PRO (A$1400) or ASI585MC PRO (A$1100). But a mono camera with filters (excluding filter-wheel - I could reuse my filter drawer to cut some cost) would be well over A$2000.\n\nJust wondering which option would have the biggest impact - image quality (camera upgrade) or more photography target options (telescope upgrade).\n\nAny thoughts / recommendations?",

Found a trick to put ur palm on the cups to re-enable them, honestly very disappointing at this price point\n\n2) Anc is basically non existent.

You can still hear full on conversations and other noises with them on. \n\nThe sound quality is good tho, slightly better then my buds 3 pro I would say too.

The opponent wont game plan to stop me, they would barely even attempt to adjust mid game like most coaches would and I would turn up the difficulty but im on SIM ALL-MADDEN.\n\n•X-Factors - where are they? Like seriously, when I came out of college I was a pure runner, when I went to the NFL is custom build my player to be like 'Lamar jackson' 99 speed and acceleration what do you think I want for my X-Factor? NOT GAMBIT the game is too easy already now i can just fucking throw into triple coverage in be fine WHERE IS ESCAPE ARTISTS OR ANY OTHER X FACTORS????? Like this feels like a no brainer, the people who are pocket passers who have access to pro reads NOT A GUY WHO HAS 4K RUSHING YARDS IN COLLEGE.\n\n• Superstar and Showdown - SEPARATE THEM like seriously separate these two games modes its lazy\n\n•Sim the league - this probably should have been the first point but what breaks this mode what makes this mode my most hated mode is the fact that I cant even be in the the draft year I graduated from and I would sim a season to be on the same year Im graduating in. Its so annoying that I'm in the same draft as jackson dart when this dude graduated before my SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL he should already have a contract or been benched how can CFB 26 a game with 136 teams do this but YALL CANT its something thats so small that so simple to do but I bet next year yall would do it shoot you might even make up watch ads with it this sorry ass excuse for a mode is horrible \n\nAnd I wouldn't be this mad because I actually really been liking dynasty but what grinds my gears is that the reveal trailer yall show off the career of the highschool kid to nifl start then GM like its a highlight of the Game its infuriating and im not taking anymore shit from this mode",

    "content": "I've been consistently playing one Senna build only for the last 4 months and it has brought me from gold to diamond with [112 wins, 64 losses](https://u.gg/lol/profile/na1/teemo-keria/champion-stats). I'm writing this in hopes that someone tries this and has a great time. I started playing this build when someone I was playing with told me to stop complaining about switching back and forth between ad and enchanter builds and just mix them, so I did. And it was awesome. The [build in question](https://imgur.com/a/oG0Hkbs) is just enchanter runes (aery, etc) and items + black cleaver. I'm not saying this is the objectively best way to play her, but for some people, it may be a whole lot of fun and it helped me climb quickly.\n\nBack when Senna was lethality, I didn't feel that she suited my cowardly playstyle. When the enchanter rework dropped, I loved it. The healing was absolutely overpowered and it felt so fun to play a marksman healer. Of course, Riot rightfully gutted the ap ratio on her Q from 80% to 60% and then to 50%, which made AD the statistically best build again. Now, every guide online says to either go [pure AD](https://mobalytics.gg/lol/champions/senna/build/support?buildID=1725881532) or pure enchanter. Yet, if you look at the top ranked Senna's globally, you'll see that many often run a mix of both.\n\n[example from rank 6 Senna according to lolalytics](https://preview.redd.it/9gl5ybr3h6uf1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=11ad2184cf2ebd736a8a3da7662d9495ee6606cf)\n\nHere's my reasoning for why this is good\n\n* Even at 50% ap scaling, [the healing is still incredible](https://imgur.com/a/3ZCekT0). Once you have 3 items, you can almost always keep your team healthy unless they get burst. At full build you can honestly just slowly walk down midlane 5v5 aram style to close the game assuming you have a lead. If your team stacks up, it's like a mini Soraka ult every few seconds.\n* On it's own, the enchanter build doesn't have enough agency. You really need your team to stack and play around you to make it viable. Adding just a little bit of AD allows you to have more direct impact. Also, Senna just needs some AD. You can't completely ignore that she's a marksman unfortunately.\n* Black cleaver, from an interactions perspective, is crazy on Senna. Aside from the health, ability haste, and AD, you get 3 stacks instantly upon hitting someone. Great item even if there isn't a huge need for armor shred.\n* Sustain on Senna is so powerful in lane. As the support, you'll inevitably hit the minions or souls, which lowers your Q cd. This allows you to heal even more. If you build some mana regen, you're set. Assuming your adc doesn't get engaged upon or burst, you can lane quite comfortably. Just make sure you make them aware that you don't intend to 2v2 unless it's a guaranteed win.\n* During fights, even on full enchanter Senna, you should be looking to constantly auto to cut your Q cd in half. If you have no AD or on hit effects, then it's kind of an inefficient playstyle. (fun tip: Runaans + Navori basically resets your Q instantly but it's a troll build)\n* I find that most of the time, people don't respect the team fight impact that hybrid Senna has. They'll target your adc or mid instead of you in team fights, which allows you to sit there and reset your q over and over, healing for like 400 each time.\n\nAs for how to play it, it's really just the same as enchanter Senna. Lane safe, understand that you're playing to scale healing, not to scale AD. Prioritize your life over collecting souls. As boring as it sounds, if you can leave lane even, or slightly ahead, you're doing well. Don't take 2v2s unless you have to (I have a 20% duel WR but a 65% teamfight WR). If you can't roam, at least look around the map to potentially skew a fight in your teams favor with your ult. Try to heal multiple people at once if possible.\n\nThat's really it, my bad for typing so much. I recommend that you try the build out if you made it this far, but it's up to you. Take my opinions with a grain of salt. I may be top 2% on Senna, but the gap between me and a GM level or Challenger level player is vast. Good luck in your games. Godspeed.",

    "content": "Hi so I’m going to be annoying and post again now that I have more information from my previous appointment. \n\nI posted earlier this week about my 1 year old not being mobile. Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/s/eTp5ppCX4A. TLDR: 1 year old isn’t mobile. Doesn’t crawl, doesn’t pull up to stand, can hold weight on his legs and can get himself into a sitting position but in a really odd way. CAN roll from his belly to his back but hasn’t since like 5months and has never rolled from his back to his belly. Will hold himself up when putting weight on his legs. \n\nI had his 1 year we’ll check on Tuesday and the doctor explained to me that he has weak muscle tone and hyper flexibility in his hips. She finally gave me the referral for early intervention and also referred me to a pediatric neurologist. I was able to get him a neurologist appointment for December (earliest I could get) and he has his EI evaluation next week. \n\n I felt a little relieve after the appointment but the neurologist referral freaked me out and after reviewing the referral form she filled out it freaked me out even more. I googled a lot of the medical terms on here and it all leads me to some form of cerebral palsy and then I end up down a rabbit hole. \n\nSo I’m wondering, can someone tell me how serious this could be based on what she wrote on the referral form which was as follows: \n\nUnder Concerns she wrote: “Hypotonia LE>YE, Delay GM”\n\nUnder Austism screening:\n“Gross Motor (at risk 5/60) all other areas normal” \n\nUnder suspected diagnosis: \n“Gross Motor Delay/Hypotonia” \n\nAs I said when I research hypotonia and hyper flexibility everything leads me to CP so can someone please give me the real deal if this is a realistic possibility? \n\nOther symptoms I seem to be researching that I also see in him: \n- millstone delays\n\n- excessive drooling and trouble swallowing — he seems to have trouble with solids. Never struggles with purées or liquors or with his bottles\n\n- hyper flexibility\n\n- unusual posture — he’ll arch his back and loves to like almost flip himself out of your arms when you try to hold him\n\n- he’s only 22lbs but he feels like a damn brick the doctor mentioned it too due to his lack of muscle tone. \n\n- breathing difficulties — he’s coughed and has sounded wheezy and crackly since he was born. Always seems to have normal oxygen levels but I took him to his doctor multiple times for his breathing during his first 6 months and he still coughs at night if he doesn’t have a humidifier in his room \n\nFor context: he was born at 39 weeks via emergency csection. I was induced at 39 weeks due to my OB’s concern of him being a big baby. Once they gave me pitocin baby’s heart rate dropped. They lowered the pitocin gradually and monitored for about an hour until it was decided I needed an emergency Csection. When he was born he was cold and my husband had to do skin to skin to warm him up while I was finishing up surgery and my son had to spend the night in a warming box. I also noticed he was jaundice at 3 days old and we were sent back to the hospital to test bilirubin levels to which we found were in normal range. \n\n",

When we were done he said he was going to go get the gm again, so I thought they were going to offer me the job. He came back and said the gm was looking for end of next week and told me it was nice meeting me and to have a good night. \n\nI really thought I was getting offered the job after all that, it seemed like it was going that direction. He didn't say we'd be in touch, he said the gm was looking for end of next week.

On failure it's -1 to main action roll.\n\nI have tried to do it multiple times and it feels awkward each time. +1/-1 feels really not that impactful, it's less than expected average of help ally action.\n\nMost often results are following: leader of the action succeeds and don't need help or it's very close but other people give -1 on check and it fails.\n\nFrom my(GM) perspective it looks like not a fun way. I prefer to use countdowns for group activities or just waiting for help ally actions from players.\n\nHow do you feel about group check?

    "content": "Hello! I rarely post on Reddit, so forgive me if I don't know some Reddit culture rules or norms. \n\nI LOVE my irl friend group. There's Me (22F), My brother (19M), and two of my closest friends, who I will refer to as B (25M) and E (24NB). They're genuinely good people who care about everyone a lot, and will do anything they can to make time in their busy lives to make sure that our weekly scheduled Dungeons and Dragons/hangout night happens. The bond we have is strong enough that even though B moved 45 minutes away a few months ago, he still happily makes the trip to see us.\n\nI'm not sure when exactly things started shifting for me, but I've found myself dreading seeing my friend group.  I've been avoiding them to the extent that I said I want to finish the shots I'm in charge of from my animation job before I join back in for DnD. The bad part is I definitely have time for DnD. \n\nThere are so many reasons this might've happened:\n\n1 - E and I have a very complicated past, which is kinda to be expected for a 10 year friendship that started in your early teens. We nearly ruined our friendship back in 2018, and even though we worked hard to resolve things and remain friends, we're both left with scars from the trauma we left each other with. A few months ago, I started feeling smothered by her. She has a very anxious attatchment style and I am definitely avoidant. I told her that I felt trapped by the label of \"E's one and only best friend\". We resolved that too, and both agree that getting rid of the \"best friend\" label we'd been holding onto since we were 12 and 14 is good for us.\n\n2 - I am chronically ill, and find myself utterly exhausted at times. Even when I have energy and feel good, if someone wants to hang out, I immediately worry that I'll run out of energy mid conversation or activity and be trapped until I can find a valid excuse to leave. I've talked about this with E and my brother, and they both agree that feeling burnt out and exhausted is a valid reason, but I can't imagine they'd believe me if I told them I'm tired and need to go as often as I feel like I need to.\n\n3 - I originally thought all this aversion toward being with my friends was because I was the Game Master for our group. It was my job to prepare the story and encounters every week before our session. While I enjoyed it at first, I quickly became overwhelmed, and stepped down as GM. My brother runs our games now, but my problem remains the same. I now wonder if it's because we want to record and produce our DnD campaign (Yes, we're all massive nerdsXD). My brother and I are very tech savvy, so it's logisically quite easy for us to set everything up and get it edited. I'm not sure if I'm afraid of the pressure of performing for a hypothetical audience or if I'm just over thinking it. \n\n4 - And of course there is also the option that maybe I'm just being a terrible friend.  I *could* push through the exhaustion and fear that comes from chronic illness, and I *could* try harder to put any residual resentment or trivial issues I have with E aside.  \n\nThe strangest part is that with online friends, I'm at perfect ease. Texting and voice/video chatting feels like no big deal. I have a very close friend online that I look forward to talking to every day, and it makes me feel so guilty that I no longer feel that way toward my irl friends. They deserve someone who gives back and puts in effort as much as they do, and I haven't been that person. \n\nI really don't want to continue my childhood habit of dropping friends when things got boring or difficult. I just can't tell if this is something I should work on about myself, or if it's a sign that my time in this friend group should be over. I'm in a transitional part of life where I'm starting to figure out what I want to do, and I know sometimes that means it's time to let friends go. (Not my brother, obviously, he's stuck with me forever whether he likes it or not XD) I'm working on getting a therapist to see if I can get this figured out, but thought I'd see if Reddit had any thoughts about what might be happening first. \n\nTL:DR: I dread hanging out with my irl friends, but texting and voice/video calling online friends is no big deal. I feel really guilty about that, and need help seeing myself clearly. ",

The match was back and forth, but the match ended with Maiavia hitting the Kahuna Splash on Boulder for the three-count pinfall.

Reynolds won the match with a Rolling Hangover Elbow Drop on Silver Eyes for the three-count pinfall. \n\n5.9 out of 10 stars. \n\nWe cut to the interviewing area, where Kimberly Reynolds is interviewing \"Marvelous\" Marshall Anderson. Kimberly Reynolds mentions that Kahuna Maiavia was injured during the main event of last week's Octane, to which \"Marvelous Marshall\" says that he should be awarded the CPWA World Heavyweight Championship since he's the number one contender.

Chloe Martinez mentions to his lordship about Kahuna Maiavia's injury and possibly relinquishing the CPWA World Heavyweight Championship. Lord Phillip Byron IV says that it was unfortunate for Maiavia to suffer such an injury, but wishes him a speedy recovery. His lordship also mentions that he should challenge for the CPWA World Heavyweight Championship against \"Marvelous\" Marshall Anderson. His lordship ends the interview by declaring himself the future CPWA World Heavyweight Champion, and when Kahuna Maiavia returns, he will rightfully accept his challenge. \n\n6.10 out of 10 stars for this segment: Solid segment for Lord Phillip Byron IV. \n\nWe cut back to the ring. \n\nAnnouncer: The following contest is scheduled for one fall with a 13-minute time limit.\n\n[Leo Arnaud's \"Bulger's Dream\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9gL33ze4RE) plays in the arena\n\nAnnouncer: Introducing first, representing The Olympians, from Miami, Florida, he is Miguel Sandoval Jr.\n\n[The Lox feat.

Both competitors went back and forth, but it would be Tevin Cash's posse that would prove to be the difference maker as Cash won the match with Power, Money, and Respect for the three-count pinfall. \n\n5.8 out of 10 stars. \n\nWe cut to the locker room of the Marvelous Alliance. \"Marvelous\" Marshall Anderson declares to Ivan Markov, Klaus Muller, General Wade, and Guerrilla God that he will be crowned CPWA World Heavyweight Champion, and there is nothing anyone can do about it. \n\n2.15 out of 10 stars for this segment: This segment was atrocious.

Throughout the match, Cynthia Steele kept antagonizing the Gordon Sisters, giving Priscilla and \"The Dominican She-Devil\" the upper hand. Not to be outdone, \"The Iron Maiden\" Mary Addams evened the odds for the Gordon Sisters, taking out Cynthia Steele.

    "content": "Hello. I've been a bit of a lurker on this sub for a while, My exact situation with coding is probably a little different to others here - clearly a lot of people are in much more advanced scenarios than me - so apologies, by my own admission - I'm something of a vibecoding 'noob.' \n\nIf you'll permit me to give some context as to what I'm currently doing with gamedev and AI, it should make my situation clearer. I'm sure my current workflow will cause much laughter and facepalming, but I'm geniunely interested in your thoughts on how I should proceed. \n\n(apologies, this is going to take some exposition!)\n\nSo, I'm very much a hobbyist game dev person. I picked up Gamemaker about 10 years ago as a curiousity. I'd not done any coding at all in over 2 decades (yes, I'm old!) - prior to this point my last coding was done in AMOS Pro on a Commodore Amiga in the early 90's! \n\nI was looking for a 2D environment (I'm making fairly retro games) with a beginner freindly language and fairly forgiving IDE, Gamemaker at the time ticked those boxes. I got the basics of the Gamemaker language (GML) down reasonably quick, but the more complex side of things were still very much a challenge. \n\nI did attempt to upgrade for a couple of years and did a course on Unity, but I really didn't feel comfortable with it, and especially C# didn't click with me. I always seem to graviate back to Gamemaker!\n\nI've started work on a fairly simple game several times in that time, a few times in GM and once in Unity - all previous attempts hit the buffers after around 6 months to a year. Usually through a combination of me struggling with the programming, project planning and real life throwing the odd curveball. \n\nBut all those failures were me coding traditionally, i.e. learning how to code via tutorials, reading manuals, articles, etc. Very much the way we used to learn coding in the 'old world!' \n\nSo, enter this new and interesting world of AI, and after ChatGPT and Google AI studio helped me in a very basic way to automate some spreadsheets and stuff, I began wondering if it could perhaps help with game dev.\n\nI'm aware AI integrations with 3rd party game engines are becoming more common, but alas, Gamemaker is lagging behind a bit in this regard. I couldn't find a proper solution, so I resolved work in Google AI Studio using GeminiPro 2.5 - with a very rudimentry approach. Literally I made a game design document and began prompting the AI one step at a time as I worked through it.  Each session - I usually have planning discussion with it, then we agree on a small number of steps, then it gives me scripts or regions of scripts and I'm copying and pasting them into the right places. All the work is done right there in the browser chat. I guess it's kind of novice vibecoding at best! I'm effetviely using it as a live/online tutor, I guess.\n\nI know the IDE very well, I've a decent grasp on the language, and I am absolutely sanity checking everything it gives me to ensure I actually understand what it's doing, and I've learned so much.  \n  \nIt can be incredibly tedious - but I can honestly say the results have been really positive (by my previous standards). I've made this same game so many times in the past, and while I've never finished it, I've had so much time to process in my mind how it should work, it's been really good. I believe I've achieved more in 3 months with this method than in any of my previous attempt. I'm actually in completely new territory. The game is coming together, I'm having fun actually playing what I've got so far, and a few people I've showed it to have been well impressed. This feels like the attempt that will work! \n\nBut, my workflow and the size that the project has got to will, I fear, be about to cause me issues going forward. \n\nAt the start of each new chat, I paste in my update to date handover document and a full text dump of the project.\n\nGemini in AI Studio uses a token system. At around the 130,000 token usage mark - the AI tends to start losing focus and halunicating, so that's cue to wrap up that session, get an updated handover and start a fresh chat. I've pushed it further, but it's law of dimishing returns. \n\nProblem is, the project dump is so big, I'm using 90,000 credits just pasting that in. We can usualy get a good some work in befor it hits the limit, but the project is expanding rapidly. \n\nI have tried using Gemini via API calls in VSCode for a more modern workflow. This caused me two problems.\n\n1) You can't have the IDE open when it's updating the project, so everything is very stop/start. Close the IDE, generate some code, open the IDE, do some testing, game crashes, copy error, close IDE, trobleshoot problem, get corrections, and so forth. I can't see GM changing any time soon to integrate better\n\n2) I actually felt so much less in control of things using this method, and that the AI was proposing more wholesale changes - if I wasn't on the ball, I could see how it could seriously break things.\n\nSo, for all it's faults - I really love my current, slightly more 'manual' workflow.   \nAnd for it's somewhat 'toy-like' nature, I love using GM and do not think I'll be moving away from that any time soon.  \nBut I'm seriously going to need an AI environment that is able to keep bigger projects in memory and context - and I think I'll need that fairly soon.\n\nGoogle AI studio has the luxury of being free. But I'm not averse to paying for something that is going to be an upgrade. But I would really like to maintain my workflow. Does anyone know what my best option would be? I don't have a huge budget, so I really want to choose my next very wisely. \n\nI thought I'd ask some folks who clearly are much further down this journey than I am - so here I am :) \n\nAny advice genniunely welcomed, and you are of course free to completely mock/rip apart my workflow for the amatuerish effort that it obviously is! But I'm very curious as to what you'd suggest. \n\nMany thanks",

But here’s the rub: Those numbers ignore the Islanders’ injury report, which reads like a who’s who of the NHL’s “Most Likely to Vanish in 2025.” Backup goalie Semyon Varlamov (knee), defenseman Ethan Bear (mystery injury), and forwards Pierre Engvall and Calum Ritchie (both lower-body) are out, leaving the Isles with a roster that’s 60% “prospects making their debut” and 40% “hope.”\n\nOn the other side, Pittsburgh’s Arturs Silovs is a rookie goalie who just recorded his first career shutout, and the Penguins’ defense—led by 18-year-old phenom Matthew Schaefer—looks like a Swiss watch: young, precise, and occasionally prone to overengineering. The Islanders, meanwhile, are expected to start 18-year-old Matthew Schaefer (yes, *another* 18-year-old Schaefer—must be a family tradition) in his debut. If this were a movie, it’d be *The Matrix* but with more Zambonis.\n\n### Digest the News: Islanders Are a Work in Progress, Penguins Are a Work of Art\n\nThe Islanders’ 35-35-12 record last season was the hockey equivalent of a Spotify Wrapped playlist: “You listened to *okay* stuff, but nobody cares.” Now, under new GM Mathieu Darche, they’re all in on rebuilding, which means this game is less about winning and more about seeing if Viktor Eklund can score on a power play\n\nTo Be Continued...(full article) [https://www.gptsportswriter.com/prediction-detail/prediction-new-york-islanders-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-2025-10-09/](https://www.gptsportswriter.com/prediction-detail/prediction-new-york-islanders-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-2025-10-09/)",

If it ever feels like a good moment for an NPC to say something that could shift a PC’s Labels, go for it.\n\nI find telling PCs to shift their labels often feels kind of random and pointless, but it seems to be the main thing the game expects the GM to do with NPC influence. Just for starters, I can't possibly memorize the current values of five labels each for four or five PCs when I have a game to run, so I'm rarely clear on what shift would even be interesting. When, why, and how do \\*you\\* apply it? Have you got an angle on it that makes it interesting and doesn't require a lot of mental overhead on the GM? Or do you just tell them to lower whatever stat they seem to like rolling, and raise a different one they haven't used much recently?",

Since I started I have continuously learned and taken on more responsibilities and became very close to my supervisor. During this time I watched her push out several employees and she talks terribly about everyone there. If this is brought to the attention of my GM she brushes it off and it's ignored. Recently my super has begun treating me bad, talking about me to other staff like I watched her do to countless other people, and it definitely feels like she's trying to push me out. I did talk to the GM and she assured me I'm going nowhere because I have done so much for them. Working 7 days a week at times and always stepping up. It doesn't surprise me her doing this to me but my question is can I do anything if she cuts my hours trying to make me quit? Idk what to do :( I'm so stressed out, there's not much work where I live and I finally just got a raise a couple months ago. Idk why it hurts me so much I just don't know what to do :(",

The powers of the church and the nearby kingdoms have been searching in vain to find this villain and put an end to her and her dark fifity  \n\nIn the Valed Kingdom, but not far from the northern border of the kingdom, rests the forest of Mistwood, and within the small former mining town of Haven, a village basically forgotten by the kingdom, is where we will meet our party as they join one of the first trade caravans to brave the journey to Haven in the last 11 years.\n\nQuestion for those wishing to make the journey: What are you looking for, and why are you going to this forgotten town?  \n\n\n\n# What This Campaign entails:\n\n **Terror of the shapeshifter**– Explore the moral questions that come from living in a world with creatures that can replace you, changelings and doppelgangers are a major focus on the fear in the world. \n\n**Experience a homebrew setting with 10,000 hours of work put into it.** \n\n**Moral Dilemmas and Secrets** – the world is laid in shades of grey, the path you choose is yours, the starting journey to Haven is where all groups start, but where you go, who you join, and what you change is up to you. \n\n**A Deeper Mystery:**  For those who love delving into the secrets of worlds and really getting into the nitty-gritty of things, the world has a deep history and even wider future. The cosmic forces that shaped this world are at play, and they step beyond the reach of gods for those able to see them. \n\n\n\n# About the Dungeon Master: Chris\n\nAs a GM, storytelling is the core of my philosophy. time and time again, I see players connect the fragments of plot I leave for them, and they see just how deep the rabbit hole goes, and they are left with my game and story living rent-free in their minds. It's an honor and a privilege to be able to tell these stories with others.\n\nI thrive on building intricate plots within plots, layered worlds with deep history, and character-driven arcs that reward effort and dedication.

I'm sort of on the edge of what could even be considered Saint-Hubert/Longueuil but can't really host and can travel wherever public transit can take me, just thought it relevant since like the west island for example is just a teensy bit FAR. Alright now onto the actual post, so I actually have a little experience with ttrpgs, although it's been a while. I have all but memorised d&d rules (not the 2024 ruleset yet though) and have given cursory glances over pathfinder, call of cthulhu, thirsty sword lesbians, and a few others I can't name off the top of my head. I am open to any system really, with a heavy leaning toward the fantastical, although I am a big fan of sci-fi too, so I'm open to trying new things. I haven't really ever played in a full campaign before and would really love to, I've mainly dmed so I'd appreciate being a player but can dm/gm if necessary (I'd be grouchy about it for a day or two before getting absorbed in the world and forgetting I'd ever been hesitant in the first place anyways, so don't worry about it). As for my play style, I love all aspects of the game, but especially roleplaying, I also love collecting little trinkets and a good shopping session (for some reason I love crunching numbers when it comes to fictional currency (couldn't care less for it irl though!). Also I'm really fluid when it comes to gender expression (with a preference for feminine things) so preferably I'd like a group that's chill with queer folk, and the mentally ill (affectionate (I've got a few quirks that'll become apparent in person, kinda difficult to communicate through text)). Alright, I've rambled enough, I'm free any time pretty much, oh also I'm 19, just thought maybe I should mention that (though I look both much younger and much older at times, guess I'm fluid in more things than gender? hehe). Also I can understand French but can't speak it well (even though I've known it my whole life) so English is preferred (if me writing this in English wasn't evidence in and of itself).  \n  Thankies for reading, I hope you have a wonderful day and wish you the best upon the adventure that is life.",

I also said that that’s not how i’ve been raised and that my mom or older sister (age irrelevant) don’t take their spouses out, i also told him that i generally think it’s it's degrading for a man to have a woman pay for him, and that thats a man’s role. It kinda ended up in a weird argument where he said that i could do something nice for him without any occasion, to which I replied that there are other nice things i could do that aren’t dates (and i do them, i gave a couple of examples) besides he doesn’t surprise me with dates or presents either so why would he expect me to do so? We made up, like i said it was just a weird argument and not a fight and i told him that i’m gonna look more into it and get back on in, but I’m not promising i’m gonna change my mind. just that… my opinion is based on tradition (i’m from central europe if it’s any relevant) and i really don’t have a good explanation other then woman shouldn’t pay for man because it’s wrong. And if it’s only that, isn’t  that kind of stupid? I’m just looking for opinions on both sides and could really use backed up arguments.

I’ve swapped out injectors and made sure the injector pump and fuel pump was working as supposed to, and it is. It keeps cranking at I don’t know how much RPM but the starter sounds good enough for it to start over but it does seem slow ish. I’m 17 and I’m trying to motor swap this into a 1994 F-250 which has a 7.3 Idi as well and the motor in said F-250 is locked up and this F-350 has no rear axle plus a lot of shit missing. My current issue is white smoke coming out of the intake manifold (I removed the filter housing and the intake round piece so it’s just the bare intake manifold) and the thing won’t hit. I’m thinking I’m losing compression but if I am I’d think the smoke wouldn’t come out. Please help me I love this F-250 and it’s a relic in my family. I want to get it running and drive it some more, any help is wanted! *Also attaching a video.*",

I need a lot of patience and trust will take time, but my god, I can give so much attention and empathy. More than most. I have extensive trauma, mental health is my life. I'm into darker things. Psych, serial killers, knives, masks, joyriding, vaping, music, oddities, cemeteries, occult. It intrigues me. I really need to find someone relatively local because I don't have that at all. But it's proving to be nearly impossible. I want so much to be a friend to someone, I'm just very damaged. And very misunderstood. \n\nPlease don't take my post down again. I don't know where to go here. I'm posting everywhere, trying to find someone who can reach me. I feel like I'm too much. I want someone who can be constant constant in my life. Over the top texting.

I really struggle with mom guilt and only being with my son on weeknights and weekends. My husband is a teacher he gets plenty of time at home with him over holiday breaks and summer, but I just feel like I’m missing so much. \n\nI’ve been contemplating the idea of slightly decreasing my schedule to 36 hours/week- I would be working 4 *longer* days (8-5:15) but I would get 1 day home per week, likely Fridays. \n\nI could potentially go further down to 32 hours/week and keep my usual 8-4:30 4 days/week, but we might suffer a bit more financially as I am the breadwinner for our family. \n\nReally struggling to weigh the pros/cons and I’m worried about making a change and then later regretting it. \n\n",

    "content": "I (19 f) was with my ex-boyfriend (21 m) for approximately 2 weeks officially before he broke up with me. This may seem silly, but the relationship was very fast-moving and impactful for me emotionally. He was the first boyfriend I had ever had, he was my first kiss, he was the first person to see me naked, he asked me how many children I wanted, met my parents, and we expressed that we wanted to have sex with each other (all within 2 weeks...). The Wednesday after meeting my parents, he asked again if I wanted to be his partner and I said yes! Then on Friday, he broke things off, saying he wasn't willing to put in the time and effort necessary to be in a relationship. \n\nNow, what is important to understand is that this relationship was euphoric but filled with anxiety for me; I was constantly terrified that I wasn't good enough and that he would break up with me, which ended up being reaffirmed by the breakup, which wasn't his fault at all, but still sucked. I kept worrying as well that we weren't that compatible of a match because we were just so different. I had a huge insecurity that he would be a better match for my best friend (also 19 f) and would leave me for her (insecurity from high school that I stupidly carry with me), heavy on that second part\n\nMy ex boyfriend was a great guy, honestly. He was super friendly and down to earth and overall had a very inviting and warm presence. It's honestly a shame that things didn't work out differently and we couldn't have been friends, because he's a really cool guy and coincidentally is around a lot of the same spaces that I'm also in. He skates with my best friend's little brother, and they have a really good friendship, which I have always admired. Unfortunately, this is the same best friend of mine that I was insecure about being more compatible with my ex than me. They have classes in the same building all day, and I know it's selfish, especially since I'm in a relationship now, but it's felt like a ticking clock waiting for them to eventually interact and find out that they're meant for each other. Furthermore, we were at a party a week ago, and they ended up talking since he knows her little brother, and now when he gets brought up, she mentions how she has a positive view of him. I have a positive view of him too; it's just overshadowed by my insecurities and emotions attached to that time period.\n\nI know that my ex and I wouldn't have worked out long-term, and it was better he was honest instead of dragging things out, but I have to admit that there has been a huge part of me that has built up a lot of resentment for him. A part of me does look back and wonder what would have happened if we hadn't broken up, but I think that's because of that whole mentality you gain after you fall in love with someone's potential, rather than their person. I suppose what I'm trying to gain is advice on how to cope with these feelings. I know my friend wouldn't go after someone I dated, I have very little grounds to be insecure, but there's this anxious gnawing feeling that chokes me up when I think about it and I really just don't know how to cope. I feel like I'm disrespecting my current boyfriend by thinking about it so much. \n\nTL;DR I was insecure in my past relationship about my friend being more compatible with my boyfriend than I was, we broke up, and now I'm afraid it might be re-affirmed now that they're closer in proximity to one another.

Welllll, I've noticed na a lot (and when I say a lot, more than 20 at least akong nakachat diri sa Reddit na 30+ up) of like-minded and age-wise people are inch in meeting and/or thinking of pursuing either friendship or relationship. I mean, I am in that same boat man sad so mao nang nahuna hunaan sad nako! Hahaha.\n\n\nHere's the idea (sa ganahan mu himo ani, you're welcome to use this as a guide! Tbh, your 31 yr old corpo curious girlie pop has been juggling too many things so having this under my bucket and spearheading an event would be too much. Pero, I am very much able to support if need be!)\n\n- Singles event\n- Late 20+s ang pwede muapil (yep, kana ra gyud akong t a r g e t m a r k e t kay i know we all know lisod na gyud to meet new ppl in this age or even try to interact).\n- Location can be in a coffee shop, or in Bee cafè / Hashbrews Cafè (they allow events)\n- Naay r e g i s t r a t i o n + screening for both men and women (for our LGBTQ++ beshiewaps, naay other groups who doe similar events like this and believe me, NONE gyud for hetero so kani lang sa ang focus). It goes without saying na naa gyuy R e g f e e which includes a Singles Kit (ex. Nametag, Game prizes, other stuff)\n\nNOTE: When I say screening, literal naay gform and consent gform na willing ihatag ang socials kay di sad pwede magpaapil ta'g scammer.\n\n- Max of 30 people lang siguro. And imake sure lang pud na dili kaayo dako ug difference ang number of guys and girls na mujoin. After all, the point of this event is to mingle with others both men AND women.\n- Program would include: GTKY, Games, Matching Games, Wall of Hey's (Hey *participant name*, youre cute bla bla kind of wall board na makawrite ang mga taw dedicated to anyone they find interesting) and others pa\n- Boxes where they provide survey or feedback form\n\nRough draft ni pero I think it covers the important parts. Hehehehe. \n\nSoooo temp check lang daw ta, naa ba diri interested IF EVER naay ingon ani na kind of event sa Cebu? 🤗",

The other features are really inhibited by the inability to do so.\n\nAlso you need to get rid of the silly \"\\[ASSET\\] is not usable in MP\\_Map\" error, why can't we place whatever game assets, buildings, and props that we want in any map? The fact you can only use assets that already exist in the map you're editing needs to be fixed, we should be able to place buildings & objects from other maps even if the textures don't fit.\n\nHopefully these tweaks come soon because I can't wait to see what we can create if we're ever able to edit terrain & have some of the arbitrary restrictions removed.",

I'd love to get your input here since many of you have years of experience already.\n\nI'm choosing between a 2022 LE purchased from a Rivian Service center in my area with 43k miles on it in Launch Green. Serial number is in the 3000s\n\nOR\n\nA 2022 LE from a Mitsubishi dealership about 200 miles away with 44k miles on it. BUT... it comes in blue, has a working tonneau and is $3k less. Serial number is in the 200s\n\nMy questions for you all. Did the earlier Rivians have more problems? Would I expect better build quality from a 3000 serial number vs a 200 serial number?\n\nAre there advantages of buying straight from Rivian vs a different big name dealership? Is that a $3000 difference?\n\nHow does the Launch Green look in person? I'm planning on doing a matte PPF so that may impact my decision. My wife already has a Blue Kia EV9 matte wrapped so we'd have the same color car which is fine.\n\nAlso, if there is anything else I should be looking for that you all may have had problems with, that would be amazing. I've bought new and used EVs so no stranger to that. This will be my first Rivian.\n\nThanks all.",

    "content": "Insider selling outpaced buys while crypto sentiment strengthened behind BTC/ETH — a mixed setup for US equities heading into the open. Macro indicators show low near-term recession risk even as sentiment cools from recent highs.\n\nKey observations:\n- Insider trades — 500 filings: $~1.9M+ in notable buys (Swedish names) vs larger/high-profile sells (NVDA $822k, HOOD founder $28M, SERV $227k); buy/sell count 140/360, overall skew slightly bearish.\n- Crypto — BTC broke out (price ~122,023, +2.5% 24h, dominance 56.8%), ETH up ~5% 24h; top small-cap mover BinanceLife +139%, rotation into select alts evident.\n- Sentiment & F&G — sentiment score 62 (“Greed”), trend falling week-over-week; VIX ~17.2 implying moderate risk appetite.\n- Recession signals — recession score 18; 10y–3m spread positive (~0.13%), high-yield OAS ~2.76% — low near-term recession probability.\n- SEC filings — NVDA 8‑K raised guidance and capital-return update (bullish); CHPT CEO bought ~$6.2M (Form 4); HOOD founder sold ~$28M (Form 4); RIVN flagged production shortfall.\n- IPO watch — recent listings: ASTN (~$850M valuation), NVHD (~$475M); upcoming HLIO (AI SaaS) targeting ~$3.2B valuation; CPRD filed in clean energy (~$1.25B).\n\nInterpretation:\nInsider buying is concentrated in smaller/foreign names while significant insider and executive selling at large US techs creates divergence. Crypto strength (BTC/ETH breakout) and benign macro/recession signals support risk assets, but falling sentiment and headline SEC filings introduce tactical caution.\n\nTraders’ takeaways:\n- Monitor clustered insider buys in small caps for early signals.\n- Watch NVDA guidance and semiconductor leadership for sector flow.\n- Expect elevated BTC/ETH volatility around breakout confirmations.\n- Treat large founder sells (HOOD) as short-term negative for retail-fintech names.\n\nHow to replicate:\n1. Filter Form 4/SEC filings by net buy value and insider role.  \n2. Overlay BTC/ETH sentiment with dominance and breakout alerts.  \n3. Track yield-curve (10y–3m) and HY OAS for recession score.  \n4. Use IPO tracker filter: status ∈ {Filed, Upcoming, Listed} and valuation > $400M.\n\nFAQ:\nQ: What does rising insider buying mean for US stocks?  \nA: Concentrated insider buying can predate outperformance, but count/value vs. high-profile sells matters for signal strength.  \nQ: How should I read crypto sentiment vs BTC dominance?  \nA: Rising dominance plus breakout alerts implies capital concentration in BTC; check alt rotation and funding rates.  \nQ: Which filings move markets fastest?  \nA: Guidance changes (8‑K) and large Form 4 buys/sells typically have immediate price impact.\n\nSource: https://tradingwizard.ai/app/market?ref=reddit — not financial advice.",

Notable buys: SEK-listed unknowns (~$1.85M and $358k), UMH (UMH) buy with large ownership change, Vail (MTN) buy; large sell: ServiceNow (SERV) $226.8k and NVDA director sale ($41.2M) in SEC filings.\n- Crypto: BTC/ETH/SOL/BNB/XRP/DOGE trends flagged as Flat; no breakout alerts — crypto sentiment neutral-to-cool with low confidence signals in scan.\n- Sentiment & F&G: Market sentiment score 30 (Fear), VIX 17.24, sentiment trend falling — implies low risk appetite and higher sensitivity to headlines.\n- Recession signals: Recession score 32; yield curve not inverted (10Y–3M +0.13%), ICE BofA HY OAS 2.76% — elevated but not extreme credit stress.\n- SEC filings: NVDA Form 4 director sale ($41.2M), META 8‑K guidance cut, RIVN exec buy ($6.4M), SPCE leadership change, Skybound AI S‑1 targeting $600M.\n- IPO watch: Recent listings: Citrine (CRYN, $620M valuation), Aurelia (AURE, $980M); upcoming GreenGrid (GGEN, $1.4B) and Nexa Robotics (NXRA filed).\n\nInterpretation\nData show institutional caution: insiders and execs are rotating—large-cap profit-taking (NVDA, META headwinds) versus selective insider accumulation and AI/EV IPO demand. Crypto flatness and Fear-readings suggest catalysts, not breadth, will drive near-term moves.\n\nTraders’ takeaways\n- Monitor clustered insider buys in small caps and Swedish tickers for early signals.\n- Treat NVDA/META filings as volatility triggers for sector pairs/options.\n- Expect muted crypto action until volatility/funding signals reappear.\n- Watch upcoming IPOs (GGEN, NXRA) as liquidity/tests of risk appetite.\n\nHow to replicate\n- Filter SEC Form 4 by net buy/sell and >$5M value.  \n- Overlay sentiment score and VIX with crypto sentiment feed.  \n- Add recession score + yield-curve filter (10Y–3M).  \n- Use IPO tracker for filings (S‑1) and valuation >$500M.\n\nFAQ\nQ: What does rising insider buying mean for US stocks?  \nA: Often signals management confidence and potential support, but size, timing, and context vs. sector/market breadth matter.  \nQ: How should I read a flat crypto trend?  \nA: Flat across majors implies low conviction — expect range-bound action until macro or network-specific catalysts.  \n\nhttps://tradingwizard.ai/app/market?ref=reddit — not financial advice.",

    "content": "Bought a few hundred more shares at $13.50. If this goes into 12s or below I'm going to get another 1500. I'm sitting on almost six figures worth of shares averaging $11.45 per share. \n\n\nMy biggest concern with my bet was the fate of the Georgia plant. Seems like a done deal with the DOE loan looking like it won't be cancelled. They broke ground and are setting up HQ2 in Atlanta.  In 3 years they are going to be able to produce 620,000 vehicles annually. R2 is looking to be a grand slam. I used to see 1 Rivian a month last year. Now I see 3-4 when I go grocery shopping. Almost all of the Amazon trucks I see now are Rivian. They are making traction.\n\nTheir Autonomy platform is currently valued at $0 which is insane considering RJ himself said he was \"very very very bullish\" on their autonomy capabilities and has been touting it in multiple investor conferences these past couple of months. RJ has subtly indicated that their approach to autonomy is vastly superior to Tesla's vision only approach with the adoption of AI model training using multiple sensors over the previous rules-based approach where vision-only made more sense. They're going to have point to point in 2026. If Tesla can hit a +$700 billion valuation on their autonomy platform, then surely if what RJ is saying is true, that should easily give them an additional measly $100 Billion? Hell even a $20 bil boost would bring this stock to $40. The fact that they can sell their autonomy platform to the suite of millions of VW products that are going to be building off the joint venture architecture has wild implications to the valuation of their autonomy platform.\n\n\nIn 2030 I see them selling 600k vehicles annually once the plants are up and running, selling autonomy products, making money on their charging infrastructure. Making money on their JV platform. Most likely additional orders from Amazon for their vans. Battery prices are crashing so it's going to be cheaper to build these cars. R2 and R3 were designed with European markets in mind. They are going to be expanding across the pond. US EV adoption is in its infancy right now. No where to go but up, especially with ICE manufacturers pulling back on their EV ambitions.\n\nPeople are tired of Tesla Model Y/3 and Elon Musk in general. The Cybertruck platform is a complete disaster. The Semi platform is non-existent. Rideshare is less than 5% of all miles travelled annually in the US.  Tesla is now years behind in the truck/SUV market. I made ~2000% on my TSLA stock and sold the last of it this year. It's just a fan boy circlejerk stock at this point.  \n\nThe current price for Rivian is comical at this point considering the catalysts that are coming in the next  6-12 months. I haven't been this excited about a stock since Chipotle IPO.",

Net premium profit = 0.95 (\\~83% of premium captured, \\~3.65% of capital). Only held for 3 trading days, so quick and efficient trade. Market quickly moved in our favour and we were able to close the trade almost 2 weeks in advance.\n* **OUST → $27 Put (opened 09/29 with DTE 10/17)**, premium 1.95 → closed at 0.30. Net premium profit = 1.65 (\\~85% of premium captured, \\~6.11% of capital). Held for 6 trading days. Market moved in our favour so the price action was obeyed.

Cloud Infra will boom with AI growth so I am happy owning this stock. $37.5 is also a good support.\n* **DAVE → $200 Put, expiry 11/21 (7 weeks DTE), premium 24 → 2400/20000 = 12%.** DAVE is a strong fin tech player. Steady customer acquisition. Has held good historical premiums so a good wheeling stock.\n* **RIVN → $13 Put, expiry 11/7 (5 weeks DTE), premium 0.90 → 90/1300 = 6.9%.** RIVN delivery numbers are growing.\n\n Pictures attached show the decision points I use to quickly select my trades.\n\nWould be happy to hear your opinions on my trades.

It has already considerably exceeded the 114,432 EVs that it sold in all of last year, and there’s still an entire quarter to go in 2025. However, EV sales will slow down in Q4 because of the big Q3 push to buy EVs before [the end of the tax credit](https://insideevs.com/news/774060/last-day-ev-tax-credit/).\"\n\n\"Tesla said Q3 deliveries came in at 497,099, easily topping Bloomberg consensus estimates of around 439,800 and the 462,890 units delivered a year ago. Tesla said Q3's total was a new quarterly record for the company.\"\n\n\"Ford EV sales hit a record 30,612 in the quarter, up 30.2%, led by the Mach-E hitting 20,177 units sold, up a robust 50.7%. Ford said the F-150 Lightning hit a Q3 record 10,005 pickups sold, up nearly 40% and making it the bestselling EV pickup in the US, ahead of Rivian’s ([RIVN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RIVN)) R1S and Tesla’s ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) Cybertruck.\"\n\n\"...Rivian is reporting 13,201 deliveries for the quarter, besting its expectation of 12,955 deliveries by a solid 246 vehicles. As we move into Q4, Rivian has also honed in on its annual guidance in deliveries, which is now expected to land somewhere between 41,500 to 43,500 BEVs.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "First of all, this is my first DD post on the Pennystocks sub so go easy on me.  I'm going to say a few things about myself.\n\n1.  I post FIRST.  You heard this from me, not someone else.  When this blows up, I'm taking full credit!\n2.  I do not write using AI at all.  I can't stand it and I won't do it.\n3.  I am not a fan of Pump and Dump.  I prefer things that go up over time so I can hold them and not have to worry that they tanked while I was mowing the lawn.\n4.  I don't post things that already jumped up and act like I had a crystal ball!  Look at the time of my post and look at the price at that time if you don't believe me.\n\nThe current price of ARXRF is $0.025.  Yep, you read that right - 2.5¢.  It is the ultimate definition of a penny stock!  And that's why this will be a 100 bagger if not more.  Before you say it's not possible.  Look at what is happening with LAC/LTUM.  ARXRF is next but it will be bigger.  I wouldn't sell until it hits $3-$4 which I expect to take some time (years) - again, not a pump and dump!\n\n\nSo let's start...\n\nWhat is Imagine Lithium Inc ($ARXRF)?  From their website, \"Imagine Lithium is a junior mining exploration company focused on the exploration and development of advanced mineral projects. The company holds 100% of the growing Jackpot lithium property located near Nipigon, Ont.\"\n\nOk, so what is the Jackpot property?  The Jackpot property is a large Lithium deposit with over 8 million tons of Li2O.  Gee, that doesn't sound like much, right?  Wrong!  The global reserve of Lithium is not even 30 million tons!  Also, the property is right on the highway so it's about as easy as it gets to mine and truck stuff out of there.  The company has a very small market cap and with access to this much Lithium, they are grossly undervalued.\n\nWhat is Lithium?  Lithium is one of the most sought after resources right now because it is used in all of our battery technology and our electric vehicles.  The US government has made a recent grab on any Lithium company that they can get their hands on.  In addition to that, Tesla has it's own growing supply chain of Lithium.\n\nYou may have noticed these two companies: LAC, LTUM.  They recently boomed because of the Critical Minerals boom.\n\nGreat news that is behind us:\n1. A new CEO, Simone Sze Man Suen took over the company in July.\n2. New discoveries have been made on the current Jackpot property. I'm not going to copy / paste google.  Look up the details.\n\nThe catalysts ahead for this company:\n\n1. As the Canadian government is watching the US grab everything they can, they are not just sitting there watching the US Scoop up deals with all of these Canada based minerals companies.\n\n2. So now that governments have started to take over the Lithium industry, the auto makers are going to scramble.  LCID, FORD, GM, and all of the usual players will be there.\n\n3. Guess who else is about to make a grab for Lithium?  Archer and Joby.  There is obviously a deal happening between Archer and Tesla right now... where do you think those Midnight batteries are going to come from?  They are shopping a guaranteed supplier.\n\n4. US Government funding.  I list this last because it would be the biggest catalyst but I will also tell you now that this is extremely unlikely.  Imagine Lithium is not a US Company and not on US Soil.\n\n\n\n\nOK, that is all for now.  I hope you enjoyed my DD.  Good luck to us all!",

    "content": "Barrons.com\n10/07/25 4:36 AM\n\nEveryone had an easy time selling electric vehicles in the third quarter. Now investor attention turns to the fourth quarter. Selling EVs will become more challenging without the $7,500 federal purchase tax credit.\n\nLucid reported third-quarter deliveries of 4,078 vehicles on Monday evening, a quarterly record and a 47% year- over-year increase. The company's numbers follow Tesla's record third quarter. It delivered almost 500,000 vehicles globally.\n\nFord Motor and General Motors also posted strong EV sales. Ford sold almost 31,000 EVs to Americans in the third quarter, up 30% year over year, accounting for almost 6% of total car sales. GM sold almost 67,000, up 110% year over year, accounting for more than 9% of total car sales.\n\nAmerican buyers were rushing to beat the elimination of the tax credit, which expired at the end of September, removed in President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill passed on July 4.\n\nLucid's stock wasn't getting a bump from the sales record, though. Shares were down 1.1% at $23.76 in premarket trading, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were flat.\n\nThere are several reasons for that. For starters, Wall Street was looking for closer to 5,000 deliveries, according to FactSet. Another reason is the credit loss. No one knows exactly how U.S. EV sales will turn out in the fourth quarter, but they will be lower than third-quarter sales.\n\nLucid makes many cars that were expensive to qualify for the $7,500 tax credit, but any EV could qualify for the credit if it was leased. It was a loophole in the system for buyers of more expensive cars.\n\nThe company's reverse stock split, completed in early September, may also be an issue. Investors don't like them. Traditional splits can be taken as a signal that management expects gains in the future. Reverse splits can signal the opposite.",

We use the same DTE as a look back period. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).\n    \n- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.\n\n- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.\n\n- **Expiration:** 2025-10-10.\n\n- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are \"cheaper.\" High numbers mean options are \"expensive.\"\n\n- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.\n\n- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.\n\n- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have \"weeklies\", the underlying is \"too cheap\", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.",

    "content": "I will post a separate comment with a link to the detail behind each option sold this week.\n\nAfter week 40 the average premium per week is $1,337 with an annual projection of $69,542.\n\nAll things considered, the portfolio is up $163,497 (+51.06%) on the year and up $203,854 (+72.83% over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.\n\nAll options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.\n\nAll options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. \n\nI will contribute $600 for this week on Tuesday, a 27 week contribution streak.\n\nThe portfolio is comprised of 100 unique tickers, down from 101 last week. These 100 tickers have a value of $479k. I also have 212 open option positions, up from 200 last week. The options have a total value of $4k. The total of the shares and options is $483k.

The percentage is taken directly from my brokerage account. Although, taxes are a major part of investing, I don’t disclose my personal tax information.\n\n2025 through 2028 LEAPS\nIn addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man’s covered calls (PMCC). The LEAPS are up $45,529 this week and are up +$242,555 overall.\n\nSee r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.\n\nLEAPS note 1: the 2025 LEAPS expired 1/17/25. They were up $36,440 overall with a 233.74% increase. The major drivers were AMZN and CRWD.\n\nLEAPS note 2: After holding for 2 years, I exercised an AMZN $80 strike from 2023 up +$11,395 (+463.21%) and CRWD $95 strike from 2023, up +$21,830 (+663.53%)\n\nLEAPS note 3: Purchased 1/16/26 CRWD LEAPS for $8,230.03 on 1/17/24. I sold this LEAPS on 6/5/25 for $21,659 for a realized profit of $13,428.97 (+163.18%) \n\nLast year I sold 1,459 options and 1,400 YTD in 2025.\n\nTotal premium by year:\n2022 $8,551 in premium |\n2023 $22,909 in premium |\n2024 $47,640 in premium |\n2025 $53,494 YTD I\n\nPremium by month\nJanuary $6,349 |\nFebruary $5,209 |\nMarch $727 |\nApril $5,231 |\nMay $7,799 |\nJune $6,900 |\nJuly $5,951 |\nAugust $4,279 |\nSeptember $8,849 |\nOctober $2,200 |\n\n\nTop 5 premium gainers for the year:\n\nHOOD $10,188 |\nRDDT $2,829 |\nCRWD $2,805 |\nCRSP $2,686 |\nARM $2,056 |\n\nPremium for the month by year:\n\nOct 2022 $771 |\nOct 2023 $2,193 |\nOct 2024 $5,839 |\nOct 2025 $2,200 |\n\nTop 5 premium gainers for the month:\n\nHOOD $523 |\nCRSP $390 |\nMRVL $214 |\nNTLA $161 |\nARM $160 |\n\nAnnual results:\n\n2023 up $65,403 (+41.31%)\n2024 up $64,610 (+29.71%)\n2025 up $163,497 (+51.06%) YTD\n\nI am over $142,511k in total options premium, since 2021. I average $29.90 per option sold. I have sold over 4,700 options. I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. \n\n\nStrategy:\nThe underlying strategy is buy and hold. I also use simple 1-legged options to supplement that strategy. Options have somewhat of a learning curve, but I believe that most people can supplement their investments using simple options with careful risk management. \n\nI sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue. I am building an income stream that will continue long into retirement.\n\nSpreadsheets:\nUnfortunately, I no longer provide spreadsheets. I received too many follow ups about formatting, pivot tables, compatibility etc.I think tracking is very important, but I post to discuss investing and options, not provide tech support for Excel. I appreciate the interest in my tracking methods, though. \n\nCommissions:\nI use Robinhood as a broker and they do not charge commissions. There is a an industry standard regulation fee of $0.03 per contract. Last year I sold just over 1,400 contracts which is just over $40.00 in fees paid in 2024. In 2025, the contract fee is $0.04, which would push the fees up to around $60 based on current projections.  \n\nThe premiums have increased significantly as my experience has expanded over the last three years. \n\nMake sure to post your wins. I look forward to reading about them!",

    "content": "I will post a separate comment with a link to the detail behind each option sold this week.\n\nAfter week 40 the average premium per week is $1,337 with an annual projection of $69,542.\n\nAll things considered, the portfolio is up $163,497 (+51.06%) on the year and up $203,854 (+72.83% over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.\n\nAll options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.\n\nAll options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. \n\nI will contribute $600 for this week on Tuesday, a 27 week contribution streak.\n\nThe portfolio is comprised of 100 unique tickers, down from 101 last week. These 100 tickers have a value of $479k. I also have 212 open option positions, up from 200 last week. The options have a total value of $4k. The total of the shares and options is $483k. The next goal on the “Road to” is Half a Million. \n\nI’m currently utilizing $39,550 in cash secured put collateral, down from $41,100 last week.\n\nPerformance comparison\n\n1 year performance (365 days)\nExpired Options +72.83% |*\nNasdaq +27.13%  |\nS&P 500 +17.82% |\nRussell 2000 +13.58% |\nDow Jones +11.30% |\n\nYTD performance\nExpired Options +51.06% |*\nNasdaq +18.15%  |\nS&P 500 +14.44% |\nRussell 2000 +10.96% |\nDow Jones +10.30% | \n\n*Taxes are not accounted for in this percentage. The percentage is taken directly from my brokerage account. Although, taxes are a major part of investing, I don’t disclose my personal tax information.\n\n2025 through 2028 LEAPS\nIn addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man’s covered calls (PMCC). The LEAPS are up $45,529 this week and are up +$242,555 overall.\n\nSee r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.\n\nLEAPS note 1: the 2025 LEAPS expired 1/17/25.

After getting into a car crash in my old truck, it struck me that I wasn’t comfortable letting Diana roam around freely in the backseat with her head out the windows. If she had been in my truck when I got in the wreck she would have likely been injured, if not killed. \n\nWhen I made my mind up that I was going to buy a 4Runner, I started researching crash tested dog crates, ultimately ending up with the VarioCage. She has plenty of room, is comfortable, and most importantly safe! Relentless DogBirds makes a variable speed fan that attaches to the crate and pushes cool air so she’s comfy, cozy, and protected! The only downside was her clumsy butt kept faceplanting when she jumped out the back (her rear legs would slip on the old mat I had in there), so I ended up buying a ramp. She uses it to get out but jumps over it to get back in. \n\nHighly recommend for any of your Dals or other dogs! If you have any questions about the crate feel free to ask! I’ll do my best to answer. \n\nCrate pictured is the VarioCage Double Crate XXL+, purchased from AdeoPets.",

    "content": "Delta’s most recent earnings smashed expectations, with Q3 adjusted EPS of $1.71 and record revenue at $15.2 billion—both figures topping analyst projections by a healthy margin. This fundamental strength played out directly on the chart, where buyers stepped in with significant volume just as the earnings cycle kicked off, snapping a multi-quarter streak of muted load factors. The technical [chart](https://flic.kr/p/2ryiAz6) visually highlights this, showing how volume surged at the lows in April as early buyers anticipated a rebound into the results, aligning with data confirming cash sales began to rise in July.\n\nMid-year, travel demand accelerated across all segments, particularly premium and corporate, lifting DAL’s shares in premarket trading after the Q3 report and providing a boost to peers United and American Airlines. The technical chart also reveals how, after this heavy buy-in during the earnings cycle, some reducing or profit-taking occurred ahead of the next round of results, as investors locked in gains and positioned defensively in anticipation of fresh figures. Delta’s guidance—now raising full-year EPS targets to the upper range—helped defend the move, as margin expansion and top-line growth trends look stable heading into the holiday travel window.\n\nFrom a trading perspective, the volume spikes around the earnings reaction mark the decisive entry of institutional buyers and retail momentum, a classic pattern for airline stocks tied heavily to their guidance and sector sentiment. Technically, watching these pre- and post-earnings pivots—where buyers step in and profit-taking emerges—is crucial for swing or long-term traders, as it often sets the stage for volatility and directional moves in DAL, echoed by the chart’s plotted pivots.\n\nFor those tracking sector rotation or earnings plays: strong fundamentals plus visible chart volume confirmation make DAL’s recent report a textbook “reaction and rotation” scenario. Keep an eye on the next support and resistance levels—volume clusters and earnings are telling a clear story, and DAL’s breakout or fade will likely follow the next round of guidance and travel demand signals.",

    "content": "Today we watched the film and I'm going to give my opinion (it's just my opinion, not the truth, if you don't agree with me, I won't be upset). The film isn't bad, but it's also not the kind where you leave the theater smiling. I will mention negative and positive points of the film below:\n\n- Negative points: The action scenes were very scarce, there are not many scenes within the schedule, the ending, which was expected to be something so grand, ended in a very weak way. The script dragged on a lot and didn't contribute to good character development, I had the feeling that it was a bit pushed. But the main mistake was: Where is Tron? He's not even mentioned, if the movie's name is Tron, he needs to appear. \n\n\n+ Positive points: The story is engaging, Jared's performance as Ares is great, there is a lot of fan service for Tron from the 80s, the games and the old grid. It was a great way to introduce classic Tron to the new generation. And yes, the film has a post-credits scene that suggests that there will be further development of the story.\n\nConclusion: The film is good, but not spectacular, it had everything to be better, but it didn't deliver everything it promised. The impression I had is that the producers may be saving energy to make better use of it in a future sequence, the post credit scene hinted at this. Anyway, this is just my opinion, but I recommend that anyone who hasn't watched it yet, watch it and draw your own conclusions.",

Like its literally everything he bought what i have selected.\n\nPicture 2 taken at Minute 4:22 \\~ roughly at the same time: When u ask urself who is this UMR fella? ofcourse it was the dude besides PING Jinxi wich btw also nearly only bought artillery. Thanks to the man Valrath on this ocation for actualy playing the game and getting troops on the ground with me. \n\nPicture 3 also taken at roughly Minute 4:30: I think this picture just shows where this will go. The Unit density on the other side is just beyond our little troops  \n\nPicture 4 taken at Minute 4:20-30: Our lovely Kaboom Guy decided to call us both Valrath and me \"NOOBS\" and apparently is in need of help for some strange reason like i didnt saw any Airborne Troopers near his Arta at the back of the Map but who am i to talk to this gloriuos Genious that PING Jinxi is \n\n  \nPictture 5 taken at Minute 7:33: The same as Picture 3 i think i need no words \n\nPicture 6 taken at Minute 9:11: PING Jinxis new aquirements to yeah i think u already guesssed it my friends ofcourse to kaboom stuff still no troopers, no recon, no helos or even one logistics truck.

Three decades of active fight to develop and strengthen the civic awareness on children’s rights. “Megjashi has brought down the silence about children’s suffering, especially physical, sexual and economic abuse of children, revealing to the publiccases of abuse and directly engaging itself into establishing more efficient mechanisms for protection of children”, says the author of the Monograph issued for the jubilee.\n\nThe jubilees are a time to remember the beginnings. “The conditions when we started helping and supporting the children affected by the war in former Yugoslavia were tense”, remember Gordana Pirkovska Zmijanac and Dragi Zmijanac. They both had a big wish to save and helpas many refugees coming by land and air, as possible. As volunteers, without any experience, they helped day and night and together with tens of other volunteers they accommodated them in shelters and camps around Skopje, provided food and hygiene means from various donors from the country and abroad, medicines, educational materials for the children, helping with everything that they could.\n\nGordana and Dragi remember that they went to MTV on 12 April 1992 to appeal for solidarity, help and caring of children affected by the war. The news editor reluctantly allowed Gordana “to say everything that she had to say in 30 seconds”. The appeal reached the Macedonian citizens, and the phone never stopped ringing, people wanted to host the children from Bosnia and Herzegovina in theirhomes, they remember. It was real solidarity and humanity in action, it was the start of “Megjashi”, then as an informal civil initiative.\n\nFollowing the first humanitarian response to the crisis, “Megjashi” expanded their work to protect children’s rights. They are especially proud of their SOS phone for children and young people which was open in 1993, with more than 20,000 calls registered so far.\n\nChildren’s workshops were long a place where the children with different origin developed their creativity and fantasy. More than 2,000 children attended the free children’s workshops, more than500 children were covered by summer camps, and around 8,500 children joined “Megjashi”.\n\n“Megjashi” team has worked with dedication on the issues of children trafficking, sexual abuse, children without identification papers, street children, peace education, etc. “Megjashi” is a school for many young people who started their careers as volunteers of the Embassy. More than 1,300 volunteershave been involved in its activities.\n\nToday, “Megjashi” is one of the organizations most recognized by the citizens, but also a dedicated partner organization of numerous civic organizations and initiatives, networks, public institutions, media and companies from the country and abroad. It has not been easy to trace the pathof the new world children’s movement in Macedonia, but “Megjashi” did it!\n\n[https://civicamobilitas.mk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tinywow\\_civic-world-en-13\\_1.pdf](https://civicamobilitas.mk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tinywow_civic-world-en-13_1.pdf)",

This is the original vinyl pressing and for a few years was the only press of this album. He was signed to Dreamworks who issued the CD and cassette releases but the vinyl was made available by the smaller Bong Load Records, which was owned by Tom Rothrock and Rob Schnapf, the same duo who co-produced his previous two albums (as well as Figure 8) and a lot of Beck stuff as well.   \nThe album was partially recorded at Abbey Road and Sunset Sound in LA, just a few miles away from the location of the mural where Elliott stood in front of for the album's artwork. The mural still stands today, albeit repainted inaccurately and partially missing as a new establishment took a chunk of the wall to make a door. ",

I have done this a few times before and thought I was working with a professional classic car dealer, WRONG! MGM intentionally and deceptively failed to disclose serious material issues with the vehcile. Sales representative, Tom Denic assured me that the vehicle was in “immaculate” condition through my phone call with him at the time of purchase and the only major issue being a passenger headlight motor that was going out and only worked 50% of the time. In addition. The posting indicated the vehicle was “well maintained” and the buyer would be “proud to own this one.” Based on these representations, and my understanding of what I thought was “show room” condition; I proceeded with the purchase ($25K after talking them down from $29,994) and an additional shipment fee ($1,295) to receive in Texas. The features included made a reasonable buyer believe everything was working with the exception of the headlight motor.\n\nUpon delivery and inspection of the vehicle, I discovered numerous issues that were not disclosed and materially affect the condition, safety, and value of the vehicle:\n\n-Passenger side window motor is completely nonfunctional.\n-Driver side window motor is failing.\n-Interior window plate is missing, compromising window integrity.\n-Driver side window is falling out of track.\n-Driver side door panel is falling off.\n-Gapping between driver window and T-Tops, which will cause water intrusion.\n-Interior fuse box panel cover is missing.\n-Both interior T-Top roof covers are missing.\n-Trunk Release/hatchback will not remain open due to defective supports.\n-Keyless Entry does not work.\n-Anti-Theft System Alarm does not work.\n-Stereo Wheel Mounted Controls\n-The integrity of the rear end is compromised with faulty springs and shocks.\n\nThese defects are inconsistent with the representations made to me prior to purchase. In a series of text messages between Mr. Denic and myself, it was ultimately agreed that the vehicle would be inspected by an auto shop and that I would obtain an estimate to bring the vehicle to a reasonably safe condition, as agreed upon at the time of purchase. A few days later the inspection was shared with Mr. Denic. Their inspection also determined that the integrity of the rear end was a serious issue that needed to be addressed.\n\nLet it also be known that other vehicle postings include pictures of doors, windows down, trunks open, etc.; therefore, proving many of these material issues were known by MGM Classic Cars and purposely withheld. As of this correspondence, Mr. Denic has not responded to me as he went silent once the inspection report was shared.\n\nWhat trash...\n\nSince, I have learned they have been sued several times and there are open litigation cases against them now, some far worse than what I experieced.\n",

    "content": "Hello everyone, I wanted to make a quick recap of my climb to MasterBall this season.\n\n\n\nWhenever I play Ranked, what I hate the most is not being able to play my game (aka bricking) or over-relying on a specific card for some common matchups. I tried some options, including old favorites and new players in the meta. For example, I used Arceus Daycare last meta and while it's pretty nice, it's really tough into Oricorio, which you face quite often so that's pretty annoying. I tried the new grass decks and Decidueye having no draw power + reliance on Rare Candy to get going meant you completely brick sometimes.\n\n\n\nEventually, I decided to try my own spin on a good ol' Silvally-Rampardos list. My idea was to use two Reds and Rocky Helmet to make sure you can OHKO everything standing in your way (with some slight exceptions).\n\n\n\nWhat I like about this deck is that you always start with your ideal Pokemon. It's pretty straight-forward and doesn't get blocked by Oricorio. It also feels pretty good in the meta right now. I mostly faced Suicune and Electric decks on the way to MB. Electric is heavily favored unless you draw very poorly. Suicune didn't feel bad to face but you have to actively think about how to use your Type:Null and when to bench things in the early game. All other gameplans are straightforward.\n\n\n\nI had a +-75% win rate from UB3 to MB.\n\n\n\nSome notes about my list and my games:\n\n\n\n\\- Type:Null is actually super clutch, you don't always want to evolve your first one. It's sometimes nice to just attack with a Null while you power up a back up on the bench. 20 ping into Silvally + Red (120) can kill most uncapped EXs for example. 20 ping + Rampardos / Red combo also kills almost everything. There were games won off a Red+Null attack after Silvally weakened an EX too.\n\n\n\n\\- 2x Red was the whole reason I wanted to try this deck. Rampardos gets OHKOs very often with them. For the few Pokemons sitting above 150HPs, you will be trying to ping them with Null or have Rocky Helmet set up the kill for Ramp.\n\n\n\n\\- 0 Cyrus, I almost never regretted not having it. This deck really aims at getting OHKOs so you're barely ever trying to kill something that is sitting on the bench. The main exception were games where I would have liked to finish off a baby because Null only did 20.\n\n\n\n\\- The main cards I often wish I had were: Giovanni / Pokemon Communication / Cyrus. Giovanni sets up OHKOs vs Babies with Null and also give a 140 swing with Rampardos for OHKO vs Darkrai/Suicune. Pokemon Communication would have been nice to trade a Silvally for a Ramp in some cases. Cyrus for obvious reasons. If you wanna try them, I'd recommend slotting them over Iono (although Iono was the closest card I could use that was \"draw power\" to get out of clunky hands/give myself a shot at getting Rampardos going) or maybe even using 2 Gio over 2 Red.\n\n\n\n\\- In some cases, I kinda wanted Mars to be a Red Card so I could disrupt hand + supporter at the same time, but Mars also powers up Silvally and is stronger in the mid game. Regardless, you really need at least one hand disruption card in this meta otherwise too many decks have too many options at their disposal.\n\n\n\n\\- Don't forget that if you're KOing yourself with Rampardos and you have nothing on the bench, you will lose and not tie (unless your opponent has no benched Pokemon either). This actually comes up more than you'd think.\n\n\n\nI know it's a long text for a simple deck but I wanted to share my experience and I think it could be helpful if you want something consistent for your MB climb!",

Actually works, but not for the reasons they advertise.\n\nIn 2 years I burned through probably $1700+ on Mars Men, and every other electrolyte powder thinking they'd fix my afternoon crashes and workout recovery. Work 10+ hour days in finance, hit the gym hard, was constantly feeling drained by 3pm despite \"perfect\" hydration.\n\nFound Menerals through some biohacker forum and it looked sketchy as hell .. tiny company, tasteless pill, claims about \"100+ minerals\" vs the standard 6 in most electrolytes. Almost didn't try it because fulvic acid sounds like something from a crystal shop. Here’s how I tracked progress..\n\nWeek 2-3: Started noticing I wasn't reaching for afternoon coffee anymore\n\nWeek 4-5: Recovery between workout days improved noticeably\n\nWeek 6-8: Sleep tracking shows 15% better deep sleep averages\n\nHere's the thing, I don't think it's the \"100+ minerals\" marketing bullshit. Pretty sure it's the fulvic acid chelation making whatever minerals are there actually absorbable instead of just expensive piss.\n\n**Honest take..** Definitely not for people who want fruit punch flavoring… Takes 2-3 weeks to notice anything.. Early benefits could be placebo, but it doesn’t go away which makes me think it actually works\n\nWorth it if you're tired of paying premium prices for basic sodium/potassium and want to experiment with absorption. Not worth it if you need immediate gratification",

This deck utilizes Ilima to bounce arceus, allowing it to function as a wall and an attacker, all while passively enabling crobat’s ability.\n\nCrobat is, in my opinion, one of the most op cards in the game. 30 damage from the bench allows both arceus and giratina to hit for a maximum of 160, but it also allows Crobat itself to do 80 damage for 1 energy with no retreat cost.\n\nThe combination of Arceus-bounce and crobat is so flexible that you can fill the deck with whatever else you want; and for Pokemon, that means the king of deck filler, Giratina. After that, cape for survivability, and  Sabrina + Cyrus for flexible field control. I was thinking about adding red card or mars, but I think I need a second opinion.

    "content": "Honestly in such a tricky spot in life right now. I think I’ve come to a good conclusion, but I don’t even know for sure anymore. \n\nFor ref I 17M junior in high school have never gotten out the “talking stage” with a relationship. I honestly try not to look too deep into it, but long story short a big mix of timing, being too young for anything serious, and just loosing feelings on both sides accumulating into this. I think I’m looking for reassurance. Is this ok? Is it ok to not date around, even if I end up losing on experience. I truly want to be with someone I really love, even if it’s a stupid dumb 2 month high school relationship. I know I sound kinda desperate or weird coming off in this paragraph, but I am starting to realize with senior year coming up, my times running out. Not to mention, I go to an all boys school. \n\nIn the back of my mind I always keep this one girl. She’s the classic elementary school best friend. Though actually after elementary we lost touch for a few years. We ended up becoming mutuals again on Instagram around 7th or 8th grade, and I actually went to her freshman year hoco. She’s not really big on school dances and I don’t think has been to a dance since. Maybe that will change with prom coming up, but I honestly doubt it. She’s super independent, and part of that is what has drawn me to her as we get older. She’s the type of girl where even if we were in a relationship, if for whatever reason we just didn’t talk for a week, I wouldn’t have any faith in our friendship, love and faithfulness. \n\nI did try to pursue things with her. Freshman year we actually went out on a small date-ish thing. We went to go watch a theater show at my school and my sister schools joined drama club. She joked about us going to try ice cream together at different places, but we were freshman, neither of us could drive and nothing ever came of it. At around Christmas that year I told her how I felt and she said she did like me, but didn’t want to try anything since we were so young and couldn’t drive and stuff. She actually was planning on coming to my families Christmas party, but we ended up not having anyone not in our direct family come. \n\nSophie year we talked a tad bit, just something every few months. At the end of the year I brought up I still felt this way, and she sent me a long paragraph. I honestly still to this day don’t know what to think of it. (It’s attatched in the pic) I’ve always known she’s had some lgbtq+ undertones, but I never found it my place to ask. \n\nWe haven’t really talked much since then. Small things here and there, last talked this summer as we always joke about the death of Harambe and celebrate it almost like an anniversary. I ended up asking her to my schools hoco but she expressed she’d love to go with me but really just wasn’t interested in dances, and to be fair I don’t blame her. She hasn’t been back to one of her school dances since we went together. \n\nI think I do love her, but I also love her as a friend. I think its clear no matter how I feel, we’ll stay in touch even if it’s small, I don’t know. Part of this has me think of that red string theory, and I actually remember watching a movie about it a while back, Your Name, it was really good, everyone in this kinda situation should watch that lol. \n\nAnyways yeah I’m really not sure what to do. Every girl since I always feel some sort of way, like I’m almost betraying my feelings for this childhood girl. Everyone has wanted us to get together for literally almost a decade. It went from jokes to a reality. The only problem is we literally couldn’t keep driving each other away if we tried. I’m very good at my sport, and I might pursue it in collage. She’s an aspiring actress with a dad already in the industry. \n\nShe actually inspired me when we were kids to do plays over the summer and school, and I got the lead guy in all of them. I really loved them but honestly haven’t done them in high school just due to time and other commitments. Maybe senior year lol. \n",

I had a few books that sold decently well, but I was a dumbass and didn't negotiate royalties. (I did it in-house on a W2... huge mistake.) To be young and dumb.\n\nThose books went on to make about $4 million (3 books...in gross revenue, not profit...but still). I truly made SLOP on it. Like legitimately, just over $100,000 over 2 years (basically a $50k salary, and that's it), and nothing since.\n\nThe money's long gone, but I just bought copies of my two old books to check print runs, and one is on its freaking 12th, the other on its 6th. And I don't get a dime....I didn't even get authorship, just a mention on the imprint page. Those books continue to sell almost 8 years later.\n\nAnyways,  I'm doing something I want to write about, and even though I know quite a few people in publishing, I think I want to go the KPD route. I think it's a very unique angle; I have tested the concept on social media/Medium and got very strong responses, so I think I could get some preorders. But I know self-publishing is a jungle. I recently came up on a little bundle $$ that should float me while I pound this out.\n\nI have a good start on it, and because I have a good amount of experience as a writer/designer/editor/marketer and in publishing, I will do most of it myself (minus copyediting because I am a sloppy af typer.) For the cover, on top of being pretty experienced in this and having done lots of covers in traditional publishing, I think I can do a good one, but I have engaged my very creative friends on concept and they are all weighing in and sending concepts that I'm pretty excited about\n\nSeems promising, I like that DSC ruler is applying MC from 9H, almost prefer the Rx than having it in Aries. Not loving the 2H sun in Libra though, and I do like lil Hermes there applying to in domicile 5H mars, approaching Cusp from 4H, which seems promising given the whole self-publishing gamble here. Not loving Venus in Virgo either but figure better to have a benefic in 3H for this than nothing at all, considering the nature of the query",

    "content": "Honestly in such a tricky spot in life right now. I think I’ve come to a good conclusion, but I don’t even know for sure anymore. \n\nFor ref I 17M junior in high school have never gotten out the “talking stage” with a relationship. I honestly try not to look too deep into it, but long story short a big mix of timing, being too young for anything serious, and just loosing feelings on both sides accumulating into this. I think I’m looking for reassurance. Is this ok? Is it ok to not date around, even if I end up losing on experience. I truly want to be with someone I really love, even if it’s a stupid dumb 2 month high school relationship. I know I sound kinda desperate or weird coming off in this paragraph, but I am starting to realize with senior year coming up, my times running out. Not to mention, I go to an all boys school. \n\nIn the back of my mind I always keep this one girl. She’s the classic elementary school best friend. Though actually after elementary we lost touch for a few years. We ended up becoming mutuals again on Instagram around 7th or 8th grade, and I actually went to her freshman year hoco. She’s not really big on school dances and I don’t think has been to a dance since. Maybe that will change with prom coming up, but I honestly doubt it. She’s super independent, and part of that is what has drawn me to her as we get older. She’s the type of girl where even if we were in a relationship, if for whatever reason we just didn’t talk for a week, I wouldn’t have any faith in our friendship, love and faithfulness. \n\nI did try to pursue things with her. Freshman year we actually went out on a small date-ish thing. We went to go watch a theater show at my school and my sister schools joined drama club. She joked about us going to try ice cream together at different places, but we were freshman, neither of us could drive and nothing ever came of it. At around Christmas that year I told her how I felt and she said she did like me, but didn’t want to try anything since we were so young and couldn’t drive and stuff. She actually was planning on coming to my families Christmas party, but we ended up not having anyone not in our direct family come. \n\nSophie year we talked a tad bit, just something every few months. At the end of the year I brought up I still felt this way, and she sent me a long paragraph. I honestly still to this day don’t know what to think of it. (It’s attatched in the pic) I’ve always known she’s had some lgbtq+ undertones, but I never found it my place to ask. \n\nWe haven’t really talked much since then. Small things here and there, last talked this summer as we always joke about the death of Harambe and celebrate it almost like an anniversary. I ended up asking her to my schools hoco but she expressed she’d love to go with me but really just wasn’t interested in dances, and to be fair I don’t blame her. She hasn’t been back to one of her school dances since we went together. \n\nI think I do love her, but I also love her as a friend. I think its clear no matter how I feel, we’ll stay in touch even if it’s small, I don’t know. Part of this has me think of that red string theory, and I actually remember watching a movie about it a while back, Your Name, it was really good, everyone in this kinda situation should watch that lol. \n\nAnyways yeah I’m really not sure what to do. Every girl since I always feel some sort of way, like I’m almost betraying my feelings for this childhood girl. Everyone has wanted us to get together for literally almost a decade. It went from jokes to a reality. The only problem is we literally couldn’t keep driving each other away if we tried. I’m very good at my sport, and I might pursue it in collage. She’s an aspiring actress with a dad already in the industry. \n\nShe actually inspired me when we were kids to do plays over the summer and school, and I got the lead guy in all of them. I really loved them but honestly haven’t done them in high school just due to time and other commitments. Maybe senior year lol. \n",

The fishing expedition thing was something was clip chimped & propagated by Trump on NewsMax, Truth Social & Rumble; & CNN just repeats it?\n\nTL;DR IIRC Letita James wasn't campaigning to go on a fishing expedition to dig up stuff to charge & persecute Trump with during an election campaign. While running for her **re-election** campaign, She cited a prior litigation experience against Trump during her previous term for why she'd be a good AG to go after Trump regarding an already on going criminal investigation. Conveniently, Trump invented this lie using sound bites right before he began singing the 5th when interrogated.\n\nits  so fucking absurd that NewsMax slop is making its way to a CNN interview w Senate Dem who won Michigan by **0.38%** of the vote. Liberal media btw. \n\n>Just before former President Donald Trump [invoked](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/aug/10/donald-trump/how-does-trump-feel-about-fifth-amendment-depends-/) the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer questions from lawyers for New York Attorney General Letitia James, he released a video that suggests James has long had it out for him.\n\n>\"Abusing the attorney general’s office to attack President Trump\" read the words across the 24-second video shared on [social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/108798613637233543) [media](https://rumble.com/v1fh3nd-attorney-general-letitia-james-1.html?utm_medium=email&utm_source=ncl_amplify&utm_campaign=220810-icymi_letitia_james_radical_witch_hunt&utm_content=ncl-AwUZ8kfAJV&_nlid=AwUZ8kfAJV&_nhids=1eYU337) Aug. 10, just before Trump went into a deposition in New York City.\n\n>The video played five James sound bites, all from statements James made before she was elected in 2018. Trump and his allies circulated the sound bites earlier this year.\n\n>They show James eyed her investigation of Trump and the Trump Organization before she was elected, vowing to sue him and saying he had laundered money. \n\n>James [began](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/20/nyregion/trump-lawsuit-letitia-james.html) the investigation in [March](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2022/attorney-general-james-takes-action-force-donald-j-trump-donald-trump-jr-and) 2019, less than three months after taking office. \n\n>Here’s a look at the sound bites and their context. \n\n>James: \"Oh, we’re going to definitely sue him. We’re going to be a real pain in the ass.\" \n\n>The clip is from a [video](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bp4waV1AMQ0/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) posted Nov. 7, 2018, the day after James was elected, on the Instagram account of [Adina Miles-Sash](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/06/09/orthodox-jewish-women-photo-ban-new-york-490778), a community activist who ran for New York City Council in 2019. In the video, which was apparently recorded before the election, Miles-Sash and James stand together at a gathering and look into the camera. \n\n>This was the relevant exchange: \n\n>Miles-Sash: \"What would you say to people who say, ‘I’m not going to bother to register to vote because my voice doesn’t make a difference?’, or ‘I’m just one person.’\"   \n\n>James: \"I say one name: Donald Trump. That should motivate you. Get off your ass and vote.\"\n\n>Miles-Sash: \"Will you sue him for us?\"\n\n>James: \"Oh, we’re going to definitely sue him. We’re going to be a real pain in the ass. He’s going to know my name personally.\"\n\n>James: \"I will never be afraid to challenge this illegitimate president.\"\n\n>James made that statement in a nearly 3½-minute [video](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/her/why-letitia-james-wants-to-take-on-donald-trump) she posted Sept. 12, 2018, on [NowThisNews.com](http://NowThisNews.com), a politically progressive social media-focused news organization. \n\n>The headline was, \"Why Letitia James Wants to Take on Donald Trump as New York's Attorney General.\" James opened the video by saying: \n\n>\"America is in uncharted territory. We are angrier and more deeply divided than we’ve ever been at any point in our history since the Civil War. And at the eye of the storm is Donald Trump, ripping families apart, threatening women’s most basic rights. I’m running for attorney general because I will never be afraid to challenge this illegitimate president when our fundamental rights are at stake. From the Muslim ban, to efforts to deport immigrants, to denying transgender students the ability to choose whatever bathroom they want, rolling back regulations to protect our planet, colluding with foreign powers, putting profits over people, dividing us in ways we haven’t seen in generations.\"\n\n>James: \"We need to focus on Donald Trump. We need to follow his money.\"\n\n>This was part of a response to a question asked of James and other Democratic New York attorney general candidates during a Sept. 16, 2018, [debate](https://youtu.be/W6ApWYgtY1w?t=1537). \n\n>The question: \"What is your view of the proper basis required to start an investigation of a person or a corporation or a nonprofit? How much smoke, if any, does there need to be? And how do you guard against a rush to judgment against someone, whether it’s an average, unknown New Yorker or Donald Trump and his associates?\"\n\n>James said attorneys general should be \"following the facts and following the evidence,\" and that \"simply opening up an investigation can ruin lives. And so with respect to Donald Trump, we need to follow his money. We need to find out where he’s laundered money. We need to find out whether or not he’s engaged in conspiracies and whether or not he’s colluded not only with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, but also with China, as well. We all know that 10 years ago, he was almost bankrupt; most domestic banks were not lending him any money. Where did he get all of the money to purchase his real estate holdings and all of his golf courses? And all of those transactions have happened here in New York City, which is why the next attorney general is absolutely critical.\"\n\n>James: \"What is fueling my soul right now is Trump.\"\n\n>James made that remark during her opening statement of an Aug. 28, 2018, debate with the Democratic candidates. \n\n>She said:\n\n>\"And what we need now, more than ever, is an experienced attorney general. I’m a former public defender, a former assistant attorney general, a former city council member and now the public advocate of the city of New York. And what is fueling this campaign, what is fueling my soul right now, is Trump and his abuses, abuses against immigrants, against women, against our environment. We need an attorney general who will stand up to Donald Trump. We need an attorney general who will combat corruption both in Albany and in Washington.\"\n\n>James: \"Illegitimate president … I look forward to going into the office of attorney general every day, suing him and then going home.\"\n\n>James made this comment during a speech July 19, 2018, to the Bronx Democratic Party in New York City, according to a nearly two-minute [video](https://m.facebook.com/LetitiaJamesforNY/videos/203059860348974) she posted to Facebook. In the video, she ended her speech by saying:\n\n>\"As the next attorney general, I see the law as a sword and as a shield to protect those who are vulnerable, because no one is above the law, including this illegitimate president. And so, I look forward to going into the office of attorney general every day, suing him, defending your rights and then going home.\"\n\n>Trump used sound bites in January\n\n>Trump played a video with the same James clips he used in his Aug. 10 video at an Arizona Republican Party rally on Jan. 18, according to a transcript from CQ Transcriptions. Trump’s son Eric tweeted a video with some of the sound bites on Jan. 27. The sound bites also appeared in a [video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1323203174818666) posted Jan. 10 on Facebook by the politically conservative website [Newsmax](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/newsmax/).\n\n>Following congressional testimony by Trump’s convicted former lawyer Michael Cohen, James [opened](https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/feb/13/impeachment-over-donald-trump-faces-more-investiga/) a civil investigation to explore whether \"Trump’s annual financial statements inflated the values of Trump’s assets to obtain favorable terms for loans and insurance coverage, while also deflating the value of other assets to reduce real estate taxes.\"\n\n>In a statement Trump issued Aug. 10 that cited some of his video’s sound bites, he said, \"I did nothing wrong\" and he called James’ investigation \"a vindictive and self-serving fishing expedition.\"\n\n>Two days earlier, the FBI executed a search warrant at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. Multiple news reports connected that  investigation to official documents brought from the White House to Mar-a-Lago. On Aug. 11, the Justice Department [asked](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-asks-judge-to-unseal-mar-a-lago-search-warrant-11660245559?mod=djemalertNEWS) a Florida judge to unseal the warrant; on Aug. 12 it was [unsealed](https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/aug/12/read-mar-lago-search-warrant-and-our-reports/).   \n\n\n[https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/aug/12/context-what-ny-attorney-general-letitia-james-sai/](https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/aug/12/context-what-ny-attorney-general-letitia-james-sai/)\n\n  \nHere's D debating AJW about it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NErRrCPRPIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NErRrCPRPIE)",

I'm trying to do neither.\n\n\nI just personally don't like seeing such negativity and hate on this sub. I have had users message me in Private messages after l've told them to stop. They have made fun of my profile, my interests, and claimed I support people I’ve never been mentioned on all of reddit. Not to mention the excessive amount of hate and lies that’ve been spread on the sub about Charlie and others. \n\n\nI use Reddit for entertainment and news not politics. \n\nI hope you can all understand where I'm coming from as a solo mod.\n\nThat’s about it, see ya",

One of the most common points was that the **game setup felt too clunky**. Some of that feedback came from playtests, some from emails, and some directly from players.\n\nPreviously, the **character**, **map**, **mode**, **difficulty**, and **modifications** were all spread across separate screens. Even inside modifications, you had to jump between windows to check your tactical gear or boosters — which made it hard to see your full setup at once.\n\nSo… we decided to rebuild it.\n\nNow, everything sits inside a single **Game Setup** screen:\n\n* You can swap between characters, maps, and modes directly using the side arrows.\n* All upgrade and modification options are grouped neatly on the left.\n* It’s much easier (and faster) to see your full setup before hitting *Start Game*.\n\nIt’s a small visual change, but it makes the whole flow a lot smoother and more ergonomic to navigate.\n\nIf you’re curious about the game, you can check out **Bug Alliance** on Steam and add it to your Wishlist here: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3018360/Bug\\_Alliance/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3018360/Bug_Alliance/)",

    "content": "So I'm looking into buying Metal Fusion Beyblades again — I grew up with some and, like many, ended up getting rid of them over time. Now that I’m collecting again, I want to make sure I understand how to identify authentic ones.\n\nFrom what I’ve gathered so far, there are supposed to be codes like “A0611” or “C2911” engraved near the barcode on the box. My understanding is that these represent the day, month, and year of production and that there might also be certain barcode formats linked to legit Takara Tomy releases. Obviously, I’m trying to avoid mid-fakes and similar knockoffs. I know there are other factors to look out for too, like decals, part quality, and pricing, but I’d like to get a clearer, overall understanding of what defines authenticity.\n\nAs an example for comparison (not asking for verification), I have a Basalt Horogium I bought on eBay a few years ago that was listed as Takara Tomy. I'm not sure how to tell if this is real, but It has A1 markings and all the correct-looking parts, but the tip tends to fall off. (Maybe that's normal though) The box originally had a barcode sticker over another one, which I removed so I could see the original. As seen, there is a code that says \"A0813\" so I'm guessing that's normal.\n\nIf anyone has resources or sites that document these codes, packaging details, or material differences, or even general tips for spotting legit Metal Fusion Beyblades, I’d really appreciate it. I’m mainly trying to learn how to identify authentic ones myself, using my current Beyblade as a reference point for comparison rather than a “real or fake” check. Thanks in advance for any insight you can share.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5guxkgbq16uf1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b355e42b02ecbc278ce3ce35c5ea919076c8ac1e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r73nt4pq16uf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc87aff9c45577733ec74c8385b9c945849664b5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8nlo64dr16uf1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3450aecaa90e8de909313ed2a5fe0201f06d9d8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gnk311pr16uf1.jpg?width=2816&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ece5bdbb77ef254d6a583aa409dc536a7db2c92\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/velnb37s16uf1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c7436d4161dd37b240bf9218144c0eff75f46eda\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3mbq5ups16uf1.jpg?width=2871&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2760a520f9294efcc7af3e241f856961c0eac0aa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/koiw9v6t16uf1.jpg?width=2957&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe1a502e398422a384e8f282eadd3cbf4cde19a2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b1uiefet16uf1.jpg?width=3471&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=caf800284eab8fe64617ecff2742f09314ae1097\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1pos3rt16uf1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=893ba3701f78bc9efa4df57cca0ef0a6f21ea0ef\n\n",

Lots of walking-heavy city days interspersed with some hiking. I’d been to Vienna before, but nowhere else in Austria, and the friend I was traveling with hadn’t been there at all. Lodgings were a mix of hotels and Airbnbs. The weather was super comfortable — generally warm and sunny but not hot, with just a couple rainy days. Obviously it was cooler in the mountains.\n\n**Me as a Traveler**  \nPretty well-seasoned, not new to one-bagging (or 1.5-bagging) or this sub, but now trying to really dial in my approach. I’ve been iterating this packing list since a three-week trip last year to Ireland and Wales, and I’m about to use it again for 12ish days in France! I typically favor city-centric trips with excursions for hiking, nature walking, etc., and I always try to go on a few runs in a new city… hence the running clothes. \n\nThis is an alt account I created for this post, because I’m super recognizable in it!\n\n**The Bag(s)**\n\n**Cotopaxi Allpa 28L.** This is the older version *without* the water bottle holder. I got a Del Día version a couple years ago and have used it faithfully since, including a three-week trip to Ireland and Wales last summer. I really love this bag (minus the lack of water bottle holder) because there’s just enough internal structure to guide my organizing without it feeling limiting or constricting. \n\nUnless otherwise specified, everything listed below fit into my Allpa. I used three packing cubes of various sizes/brands, a clear plastic baggie for liquids, a small Eagle Creek bag for other toiletries, and a small Eagle Creek mesh bag for assorted bits and bobs (snacks, hydration pouches, chargers, cords). \n\nI typically bring a mini flattish Eagle Creek tech organizer, but this time it just wasn’t working with my packing arrangement, so I tucked the cords, adapter, and charge block into various pockets in the Allpa. Plus I was only bringing my phone, Kindle, and iPad, not a full-size laptop, so I didn’t really need all the organization space from the tech organizer. I put my iPad and a paper journal into the Allpa’s laptop sleeve/pocket.  \n\n**Tom Bihn Handy Little Thing (size 2).** I borrowed this from my partner and ended up loving it. I used this on travel days to stash my wallet, sunglasses, passport, handkerchief, Kindle, soft water flask, etc. In the past I’ve paired the Allpa with a Tom Bihn medium Café bag I got secondhand, but I ended up feeling like a pack mule lugging around that size bag… I would inevitably stuff it full of crap and end up feeling unbalanced. The HLT was the perfect size for my necessities without giving me excess room to (over)fill.  \n\nI also packed the following two bags *in* my Allpa and used them at various points:\n\n* **Janji Multipass sling bag.** I originally purchased this bag for running but have also found it to be a great option for short/day hikes where I don’t need a ton of water. It's basically like a fanny pack/bum bag that goes horizontally across your chest and has a small second strap to secure it. I can put two full 8-oz soft flasks in there, along with other necessities (snacks, chapstick, wallet or just a few credit cards, etc.). There are pass-through loops for a lightweight jacket as well.\n* **Fjallraven Vardag pocket bag.** This is my EDC and I absolutely LOVE it. It’s super simple, essentially just two slim pockets with individual zips and one small interior (plastic) carabiner I usually use for my Loop earplugs. It’s just large enough to fit my Kindle in one pocket, plus my wallet, keys, and other true necessities in the other. I bought it pretty much entirely because it fits my Kindle but nothing bigger, so it keeps me minimal and will never weigh enough to bother me. I used this for most city days, alternating with the HLT when we were doing day trips (Hallstatt, Bratislava) and I wanted to bring a bit more.\n\n**What I Packed**\n\n*Italicized = wore on the plane and on most travel days*\n\nPants\n\n* Stretchy jeans\n* Greyish-green PrAna hiking pants\n* *Black linen blend wide-leg pants*\n\nTops\n\n* Chambray long-sleeved button-up shirt\n* *Plum/maroon cotton gauze long-sleeved button-up shirt*\n* Light blue short-sleeved button-up shirt\n* Rainbow striped short-sleeved button-up shirt\n* Forest green Tencel-blend short-sleeved T-shirt\n* *Light pink stretchy tank top*\n* Maroon sleeveless mockneck crop top\n\nRunning/hiking-specific clothes\n\n* Long-sleeved quarter-zip tech shirt\n* Short-sleeved tech shirt (This was a last-minute, “throw it in” packing item — was glad to have it, but didn’t necessarily need it.)\n* Bright blue Oiselle tank top\n* Black Oiselle Roga shorts\n\nPajamas\n\n* 1 lightweight tank top\n* 1 pair flannel boxers\n\nUnmentionables\n\n* 1 sports bra\n* 1 nude soft-ish bra\n* *1 soft black bra*\n* 7 pairs underwear + *1 pair for transit day*\n* 5 pairs athletic socks (rolled up and packed into Altras)\n* 1 pair squishy socks\n* *1 pair cotton socks*\n* 1 swimsuit (Sadly never used, but if I hadn’t brought it, I inevitably would’ve wanted it!)\n\nShoes\n\n* Pink Altra trail runners (primarily used for hikes)\n* *Grey Xero HFS sneakers (also used for running)*\n* 1 pair hand-knit slippers (very squishable for packing)\n\nOuterwear\n\n* *Light purple lightweight North Face jacket/hoodie*\n* Bright purple Patagonia rain jacket (packs into itself)\n* Foldable running hat\n\n**Toiletries**\n\nI'm not going to list everything (although you better believe I have it all written out!), but see above for my general setup!\n\n**Stashed in HLT 2 for Travel Days**\n\n* Small Lush hand/body lotion\n* Chapstick\n* Ethique lipstick in cardboard tube\n* One other random small lipstick I threw in at the last moment for unclear reasons\n* Small tin with medication (three prescriptions + emergency Xanax (which I didn’t need, yay!))\n* Kindle\n* Phone\n* Airpods\n* Loop earplugs\n* Corded earbuds (for plane)\n* KN-95 masks for plane\n* Small tin with mints and gum\n* Wallet\n* Small zip coin pouch\n* Passport\n* Hand sanitizer\n\n**Misc. Other Things**\n\n* Anker charging brick\n* Plug adapter\n* iPhone charging cord\n* iPad charging cord\n* Kindle charging cord\n* 2 8-oz collapsible water flasks\n* Goodr sunglasses in fabric drawstring pouch\n* Snacks (protein bars, etc.) and Skratch hydration packets\n* Journal\n* Pen\n* Pocket cribbage board + deck of cards\n* Resistance band\n\n**Clothing Hits**\n\n* Stretchy layering tank: This is just a synthetic light pink tank I got from my local Buy Nothing group, but it’s served me well on multiple trips.\n* Black linen-blend pants: Found these at a thrift store earlier in the summer and they fit perfectly and are super comfy!\n* Maroon mockneck sleeveless crop top: This was a last-minute, “throw it in” packing item — which I typically try to avoid — but I’m very glad I added it! It took up barely any space and was great paired with the black wide-leg pants for a nicer dinner and then on a particularly warm, sunny day.\n* Athletic socks: This was a learning experience from a three-week trip to Ireland/Wales last summer, where I brought primarily cotton-blend crew socks and found them a huuuge pain in the butt to wash and dry. The athletic/running socks (Balega, Injinji, and Feetures brands) didn’t get stinky and dried quickly when I washed them in the sink.\n\n**Clothing (and other) Misses**\n\n* Bringing two short-sleeved button-ups: I’m on the fence about this, because I really liked having these two options… but I could’ve saved some space by bringing just one. Plus, they’re not as versatile as a straight-up T-shirt; I couldn’t layer them with either of the long-sleeved button-ups (though they worked fine with my North Face jacket).\n* The Tencel T-shirt: Wow, this fella got STINKY. (Wait, why am I packing it for my France trip again…?)\n* The short-sleeved running shirt: I used this for hiking one day, if I recall correctly, but I really didn’t need it. I prefer running in a tank top while traveling because there’s less armpit-to-shirt contact, reducing stinkiness in the shirt. \n\n**General Thoughts**\n\n* I was super glad I made room for the pocket cribbage board and deck of cards! My friend and I had a mini tournament, playing one game in each of the five cities we stayed in, and it was a fun way to pass the time and have a throughline on our trip.\n* The resistance band took up basically no space and let me feel like I wasn’t totally neglecting my PT while traveling (trying to rehab shin splints and prehab myself for pain-free running for the long haul).\n* I gambled by not bringing the Allpa rain fly and won — no rain on our travel days! I used that tiny pocket where the rain fly is stashed for my charging cords, which worked nicely.\n* I did sink laundry twice, with varying levels of success. My timing was off on the second “load” and barely anything dried well, so my undies smelled a little… off… for the last few days of the trip. Thinking I need to get a clothesline for the future.\n* As noted, I could’ve dropped one of the short-sleeved button-ups, but I liked having options to feel a bit more put-together. The problem was that I couldn’t really layer them with the long-sleeved button-ups, only the jacket(s). Realistically, I should swap in another regular T-shirt instead, so I could wear it under a long-sleeved button-up.\n\n***...WELL,*** that was long because I'm wordy! Can you tell I'm a millennial who came of age in the Livejournal era?! Hope it wasn't too mind-numbing!\n\n\n\n**IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS:** The first image shows cutouts of various clothing items on a white background. The first row shows a chambray long-sleeved button-up shirt, a plum/maroon long-sleeved button-up shirt, a blue and white striped short-sleeved button-up shirt, and a rainbow striped short-sleeved shirt. The next row shows a forest green Tencel-blend short-sleeved T-shirt, a light pink tank top, a maroon sleeveless mockneck crop top, a bright purple Patagonia rain jacket (packs into itself)*,* and a light purple lightweight North Face jacket/hoodie. The next row shows a pair of jeans, a pair of grey-green hiking pants, and a pair of wide-leg black cotton pants. Next to that is the caption “Pajamas” with a photo of a T-shirt and plaid flannel shorts. The bottom has a caption that says “Running & Hiking (for hiking, wore middle pants above)” and shows a long-sleeved ¼-zip tech shirt, a short-sleeved running shirt, a bright blue running tank top, and a pair of black running shorts. Finally, there’s a swimsuit with the caption “Tragically Ignored Swimsuit.”\n\nThe second photo shows a fully packed Cotopaxi Allpa 28L on a couch; none of the clothes are visible because they are in packing cubes, which are zipped into the Allpa’s mesh compartments. One of the Allpa’s mesh compartments is partially unzipped to show a few items, including a bright orange toilety bag, a blue folded running hat, a Goodr sunglasses bag, and a couple other small organizing bags\n\n",

    "content": "I never thought I’d be at my biggest and somehow still feel the most beautiful in my wedding dress.\nI found my dress in January 2025 after trying on about ten different ones. That’s when I realized all I really wanted was simplicity. Subtleness. My life has been full of chaos and trauma, and this dress brought me quiet. It brought me gentleness. It made me feel like myself.\n\nThere’s no beading, no lace, no pizzazz, and it’s sleeveless (my arms have always been my biggest insecurity), but somehow it won me over. To balance out the simplicity of my wedding dress, my traditional dress for our tea ceremony is covered in beads and sparkles 😬 I’m Argentinian and my fiancé is Chinese, and I cannot wait for the tea ceremony because I feel like a total princess in that dress too!\n\nThe past few months have been a whirlwind as everything started coming together. I’ve made choices I never thought I’d make, and now, just 40 days away from the wedding with two alteration check-ins left, I’ve never felt so good.\n\nHere are some of the details I’m most excited about:\n\nTea Ceremony Dress\nOriginal budget: $400, and I found mine for $250. The seller said it had been in stock for two years and he was eager to let it go. It happened to be the only one in my size, so I guess being plus size worked in my favor this time! The dress is so detailed that I decided to keep the headpiece simple.\n\nWedding Dress\nOriginal budget: $2,500, and I found the perfect one for $1,300! I don’t think I’d want such a simple dress. But when I put it on I got a sense of calm, quiet, and subtlety. I felt most like myself in this dress than any of the others. Although it had spaghetti straps (which we are altering and removing) and my arms were fully exposed (my biggest insecurity), I fell in love. I have two alterations fittings left where we will be adding a panel to the back of the dress, extending the tie-back hoops lower into the zipper, and opening the chest with a V or sweetheart shaped alteration to extend my neck and chest. \n\nVeil\nThe one I loved in the bridal shop was $600. My sister wanted to gift it to me, but I didn’t want her spending that much, so I searched around and found a beautiful cathedral-length veil on Etsy. It’s even more stunning in person! My sister lives in Puerto Rico and I’m in Canada, so we shipped it there first to save on tariffs. Since my dress is so simple, I wanted something with a little pop, and this veil has dusty blue flowers that tie in perfectly. My bridesmaids are wearing Azazie dresses in Steel Blue, and dusty blue is one of our main colors, so it all feels meant to be.\n\nTiara\nBecause why not? I already feel like a princess. The bridal shop threw it in with my dress 🥰\n\nSleeves\nI ordered custom sleeves from Etsy. The seller was amazing and communicated every step of the way. They’re shipping from Australia and should arrive at the end of October.\n\nI’m still deciding on jewelry, so I’d love to see what\neveryone else is wearing or planning to wear!\n\nLastly, I just want to say thank you. I’ve loved coming on here every day and seeing all of your beautiful journeys. You’ve all inspired me so much and helped me see myself differently in the best way. Through this community, I learned that it’s not about being a certain size or fitting into a dress a certain way to feel beautiful for a single day. I can’t wait for my future husband, my mom, and my sisters to see walk down the aisle. \n\nNow let’s do this thing. Let’s get married, girls!! 💍✨",

    "content": "Hey guys, SSF always turn into a hot topic when market opens so I decided to drop my ~~2 cents~~ 82 cents on it.\n\n# 1 - SSF is fun but it has problems due to current inventory system.\n\nFirst of all, SSF (solo self-found) is fun but in my experience it gets stale pretty quickly due to the horrible inventory system we have in the game right now, and I'm not even talking about gold storage (yet).\n\nI think the current character inventory is too small, clunky and benefit some classes due to utility items filling up half of the available space. Some classes weapons are so huge it's simply not worth looting to sell it.\n\nI'm not a barbarian main but I imagine barbarians in SSF must hate having to drop a bunch of valuables just to loot a nice bardiche or felling axe. Their weapons are not better than a dagger or sword but they occupy a huge chunk of their inventory.\n\n**Short term Solution:** We know the inventory guy left the company but can we at least get 2 rows of inventory space (horizontal)? Each character starting with 2 free stashes instead of 1 would also be dope.\n\n**Long term Solution:** I know it's all planned already but we need backpacks, potion packs & utility item packs. What about quivers? Well, these will be the main feature of Dark and Darker 3.\n\n# 2 - Gold storage sucks ass.\n\nDoes anyone here loves the current gold storage system? How many of you developed carpal tunnel syndrome by transfering 50g coin purses from stash to stash, character to character?\n\nThe numbers on purses, pouches and bags are outdated. As people have already mentioned in other discussions, it's from an era where 100g was worth 1000g\n\nI know many will disagree with me here but I think removing the physical gold storage entirely and simply turning it into a number is also not the move. It became a staple of this game (even though it's ass rn)\n\nGetting more storage is satisfying and it's a nice way to notice your progression, maybe I'm a masochist but the feeling of getting your first row of 1000g bags, then selling them and upgrading to 2500g bags is nice, don't even talk about getting your first chest.\n\nThe issue here is the numbers, it NEEDS to be increased.\n\n**Solution:** Increase the numbers!\n\n\\- Purse = 50g > 150g\n\n\\- Pouch = 250g > 500g (change crafting cost to 2-2-2)\n\n\\- Bag = 1000g > 2500g\n\n\\- Spectral Bag = 2500g > 10000g (yeah, massive buff because getting all of these annoying ingredients without using the market NEEDS to be something rewarding)\n\n\\- Chest = 10000g > 30000g (in this scenario, bangle lord quest probably wouldn't be so easy/readily available).\n\n# 3 - SSF vs Marketplace.\n\nAs I said before, IMO SSF is fun but I also think absolute SSF gets stale. Not only due to the inventory/gold management but also because getting everything by yourself is a hassle. I don't wanna kill 27 wisps to be able to craft a mana sphere. Yeah the item is good but it's simply not worth the time in SSF.\n\nI think we need a progressive system to dictate the market/trading hall, where basic and intermediary stuff will be sellable after some time. High tier loot like legendary, uniques and artifacts would be BANNED from the market/trading through most of the season, only being sellable in later months.\n\nI'll give an example below but be aware that it wasn’t planned in detail, it’s just a rough idea so you get what I'm saying. It's probably full of flaws and I would love to hear your thoughts about it.\n\n# Marketing/Trading regulation schedule:\n\n**1st and 2nd Week:**\n\n\\- Absolute SSF, market and trading doesn't exist in this stage.\n\n**3rd Week:**\n\n\\- Basic crafting materials: Iron, flowers, silver, etc)  \n\\- Basic consumables and utility: Surgical kits, prot pots.  \n\\- Gold storage and it's ingredients.\n\n**4th Week:**\n\n\\- Consumables (up to green rarity)  \n**-** More crafting materials (copper, cobalt)\n\n**5th Week:**\n\n\\- Gear (up to blue rarity.)\n\n**= BIG GAP between week 5 and 8 explaining:** Here people will be buying and selling tons of blue \"bis\" they accumulated over the month, blue gear and gems are so abundant right now that every gear fear Timmy and their grandmas will be able to buy gear. Blue is supposed to be the new white in this stage.\n\nThose who enjoying looting/bossing/crafting will still have the purple/legendary advantage over market enjoyers, unless they arrive late at wipe (at least they can buy blues to compete with others).\n\n**8th Week:**\n\n\\- Consumables (up to blue rarity)  \n\\- Gear (up to purple rarity) - Here things will start to be like it is right now, except legendaries, uniques and artifacts are still out of trading/market.  \n\\- Rubysilver, gold and froststone ingredients and gear.\n\n**12th Week:**  \n\\- No more regulations, embrace the chaos.\n\n# Extra stuff that needs mentioning:\n\n**- MAKE ARENA SSF/minted AGAIN, MARKETPLACE ARENA = ASS**\n\n\\- Navigating the market and selling stuff is so clunky, it definitely needs a overhaul.\n\n\\- Merchants offers shouldn't be RNG (I don't wanna buy a club, I want a rapier!)\n\n\\- Quest rewards should work like tokens rewards, let us choose between 3 items.\n\n\\- Show us the refresh timers on merchants (wasn't this a thing or am I going crazy?)\n\n**-** Why is it called \"solo self-found\"? Shouldn't it be only \"self-found\"?\n\n\\- Enable goblin recovery to SSF gear.\n\nThat's it, I took a break at the start of season 6 but this season made me enjoy the game again and I would love to see DaD last years and years.\n\nSorry if formatting is wonky, I'm typing from my PC but for some reason there are a few gaps between items which I can't move/delete.\n\nEdit: I figured out how to fix the weird spaces between items",

Seriously?\n\nI installed and sign up this apps on August, 2025. 2 months ago.\n\nAnd just play two games without answering any paid surveys.\n\nFirst game, puzzle and chaos. Play for 1 month. Provider: Freecash. No issue.\n\nSecond game, call of dragons. Play for 1 month. Provider: AdGate. Issue appear: Chargeback.\n\nThis really the dark side of Freecash apps: Chargebacks\n\nDo you know that, in 2 months I've used your apps to play two games I mentioned above, I just got $26.01 in total.\n\n2 months = 2 games = $26.01\n\nLuckily, what happened to other users where their earnings were deducted after the chargeback was reported did not happen to me.\n\nThis is because I had redeemed this reward of $25 into my PayPal and got $23.75 after deducting the fees before this chargeback was reported.\n\nOtherwise, all $26.01 that I earned from playing the games would have been deducted and what I had done for 2 months in this app would have been in vain.\n\nWhat a relief.\n\nNow, my balance is only $1.01.\n\nA chargeback was reported by AdGate but you couldn't deduct my balance because it wasn't enough, right? Huhu.\n\nSo, I'm stopping here.\n\nI don't want to take the risk of continuing to use your app to earn extra money.\n\nBy the way, thank you for $23.75 that I earned from your apps in 2 months used it.\n\nSo, guys, be careful with this apps.\n\n(An honest and sincere review from me)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lv8i6wze07uf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85296229879a714f6d8c1666997284753eccb097\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ltag7vze07uf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5cb4026039b99b1c06b4ebf08ad213a2536f061e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jv4ecc0f07uf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4fa681f3c2f00669a4f7380756c985c881fc0e46\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6ojn32f07uf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f390411eb9e158390166bd251a91c567e29cf87\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6fw9t92f07uf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60ca0d123532d9447030c1fffe8afd4459cfdf3d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iga76f0f07uf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b077215f0cc8b4f8aa230206d3b3a5fd5e0c079",

If you're skeptical, please do your own independent search on this (you will find thousands of people doing this daily). This is a side hustle where you collect free daily bonuses from sweepstakes sites to collect \\~$400+ a month.\n\n**The more immediate and lucrative part of this side hustle is farming the welcome offers from the sites. To make it as easy as possible, here is the exec summary of this:**\n\n1. Sites will offer you a heavily discounted offer for \"SC\" (coins that can be exchanged for real money). You can simply buy these packages at crazy rates like $15 for 40 SC ($40).\n2. Now that you have 40 SC, you will be required to play this amount through once, in order to redeem it to your bank. Simply play the highest RTP game (return-to-player) on the lowest bet possible (usually 5 cents) just enough times to playthrough all 40 SC. Set it to auto spin, and turbo/quick spin settings to do this quicker. We call this \"washing\".\n3. On average, you will keep around 95%. In a worst case scenario, you will keep 90%. Therefore, you will walk away with on average \\~$36, when you only spent $15 to acquire, making this scenario a $21 profit.\n4. If you run through all the welcome offers below, you can genuinely make ~$700 in less than an hour. And if you do this consistently every month, people make upwards of $1,000+.\n\n**Here is the directory for the welcome offers, ranked by attractiveness** (Note: Welcome offers can vary per user, but the offers displayed below are the most common)**:**\n\n**1.** [**Legendz**](https://tracker.gemified.io/r/8gAMYu7DruEN/68cc30a42c36d1428856200f) **($100 total profit)**\n\n$100 for 200 SC\n\n*Best game to wash with:* Legendz Plinko (set risk to low & 16 rows)\n\n**2.** [**Jackpota**](https://www.jackpota.com/?r=188778916) **($71 total profit)**\n\nProgressive bonuses (next deals sequentially unlock after each purchase)\n\n1st: $10 for 25 SC (+$15)  \n2nd: $20 for 40 SC (+$20)  \n3rd: $75 for 100 SC (+$25)  \n4th: $45 for 56 SC (+$11)\n\n*Best game to wash with:* UPlinko (set risk to low & 16 rows)\n\n**3.** [**Spree**](https://tracker.gemified.io/r/8gAMYu7DruEN/68cc30a72c36d14288562025) **($60 total profit)**\n\nProgressive bonuses (next deals sequentially unlock after each purchase)\n\n1st: $20 for 60 SC (+$40)  \n2nd: $20 for 40 SC (+$20)  \n($60 total profit)\n\n*Best game to wash with:* Gravity Plinko (level set to low), Epic Joker (97% RTP)\n\n**4.** [**McLuck**](https://tracker.gemified.io/r/8gAMYu7DruEN/68cc30972c36d14288561fcd) **($60 total profit)**\n\nProgressive bonuses (next deals sequentially unlock after each purchase)\n\n1st: $10 for 25 SC (+$15)  \n2nd: $20 for 40 SC (+$20)  \n3rd: $75 for 100 SC (+$25)\n\n*Best game to wash with:* Gravity Plinko (level set to low), Gravity Blackjack (Basic Strategy) (99.46% RTP), Gravity Roulette (Red + Odd) (97.3% RTP)\n\n**5.** [**PlayFame**](https://tracker.gemified.io/r/8gAMYu7DruEN/68cc30a22c36d14288561ff9) **($60 total profit)**\n\nProgressive bonuses (next deals sequentially unlock after each purchase)\n\n1st: $10 for 25 SC (+$15)  \n2nd: $20 for 40 SC (+$20)  \n3rd: $75 for 100 SC (+$25)\n\n*Best game to wash with:* Gravity Plinko (level set to low), Gravity Blackjack (Basic Strategy) (99.46% RTP), Gravity Roulette (Red + Odd) (97.3% RTP)\n\n**6.** [**SpinBlitz**](https://tracker.gemified.io/r/8gAMYu7DruEN/68cc309e2c36d14288561fe3) **($55 total profit estimated w/ free spins)**\n\nProgressive bonuses (next deals sequentially unlock after each purchase)\n\n1st: $10 for 10 SC & 30 free spins ($0.50/spin)  \n2nd: $20 for 40 SC (+$20)  \n3rd: $75 for 100 SC (+$25)\n\n*Best game to wash with:* Gravity Plinko (level set to low), Gravity Blackjack (Basic Strategy) (99.46% RTP), Gravity Roulette (Red + Odd) (97.3% RTP)\n\n**7.** [**CrownCoins**](https://crowncoinscasino.com/?utm_campaign=84efb4ce-42c9-4636-9946-7d9c39c5e8b2&utm_source=friends) **($41 total profit)**\n\n$23.99 for 65 SC ($41 total profit)\n\n*Best game to wash with:* Turbo Mines (Set 2 mines, autobet 1 square only), Epic Joker (97% RTP)\n\n**8.** [**RealPrize**](https://tracker.gemified.io/r/8gAMYu7DruEN/68cc30932c36d14288561fb7) **($35 total profit)**\n\n$35 for 70 SC ($35 total profit)\n\n*Best game to wash with:* Gravity Plinko (level set to low)\n\n**9.** [**Pulsz**](https://tracker.gemified.io/r/8gAMYu7DruEN/68cc30aa2c36d1428856203b) **($15 total profit)**\n\n$10 for 25 SC ($15 total profit)\n\n*Best game to wash with:* Multihand Blackjack (Basic Strategy) (99.38% RTP), Epic Joker (97% RTP)\n\n**10.** [**Modo**](https://modo.us/?referralCode=V62FT4) **($90 total profit)**\n\n$210 for 300 SC ($90 total profit)\n\n*Best game to wash with:* Blackjack (Basic Strategy), Epic Joker (97% RTP)\n\n**11.** [**Pulsz Bingo**](http://www.pulszbingo.com/?invited_by=qgtnds) **($40 total profit)**\n\n$40 for 80 SC ($40 total profit)\n\n*Best game to wash with:* Epic Joker (97% RTP), Blackjack (Basic Strategy)\n\n**12.** [**Lone Star**](https://lonestarcasino.com/refer/551699) **($30 total profit)**\n\n$20 for 50 SC ($30 total profit)\n\n*Best game to wash with:* Dragons Awakening (96.96% RTP)\n\n**13.** [**Wow Vegas**](https://www.wowvegas.com/?raf=8279094) **($20 total profit)**\n\n$10 for 30 SC ($20 total profit)\n\n*Best game to wash with:* Mystery Garden (97% RTP), Auto Roulette (Red + Odd), Gravity Blackjack (Basic Strategy) (99.46% RTP)\n\n**If you farm everything on this list, you should literally be able to make \\~$650 or more in one day.**\n\nAlso note, that after purchasing the first welcome offer, you will be presented with follow up offers which are just as lucrative as well.

    "content": "Chapter 14: Rank 1 Middle Stage\n\n​\n\nBefore he began, Kevin took out the pouch from chief Raz and counted.\n\nIt was far more than he had anticipated. A whopping two hundred coins. Oh right, it was supposed to be a reward for two. Silly him.\n\nWith that understanding, he had to hide the fact that he was the one who killed his uncle even deeper than before. That wasn’t something they needed to know.\n\nNow that he had this much money, he could charge through the stages and might even reach Rank 2 by day’s end. He didn’t need coins to raise his cultivation to Rank 1 Middle Stage, but he was certain, as the sun would rise tomorrow, that he would need them from the Peak Stage onward.\n\nKevin sat cross-legged on his bed and closed his eyes. With his mind’s eye, his inner space came into view.\n\nLightning Spike and Lightning Step were chasing each other around, leaving playful sparks on the surface of the essence pool. The newest addition, Earth Wall, was floating lazily next to them. Little Fat Fuck was still lying listlessly near his Aether Tree while nibbling on a yellow aether star. The sight of his baby being so weak still broke his heart. He wished he could heal his skill faster.\n\nBut then he noticed something. Little Fat Fuck was nibbling on a *yellow* star. A *Lightning Path* aether star.\n\nHis mind’s eye snapped toward the sky of his inner space. The blue Water Path aether stars were fewer than before, but they were still numerous. Yet, his baby was eating *his* own aether stars.\n\n“Little Fat Fuck, stop!” His will jumped out from inside his Aether Tree and squished the whale’s cheeks. Even their signature squishiness had diminished from that of a baby’s butt to that of a truck’s tire. It saddened him.\n\nThe little whale refused to cooperate and swallowed the star whole instead. He let out a satisfied burp, then looked up at Kevin with his beady, black eyes full of innocent mischief. Ugh, his baby knew his weakness too well.\n\n“Okay, okay, I can’t be mad at you.” Kevin rubbed his cheek against the whale’s, feeling the softness and squishiness. “But next time, don’t eat those.”\n\nWith a wave of his hand, the aether stars in the sky separated into two sides, turning one side of the dark sky brilliant yellow and the other watery blue. Little Fat Fuck’s tail wagged excitedly. The little whale knew exactly what this meant.\n\nKevin pointed at the blue constellations. “Eat anything on that side. Just like before, okay?”\n\nThe little whale let out a soft ‘uuu’ before sucking down a Water Path aether star into his mouth and started nibbling it. So damned precious.\n\nIt was the same in his previous life. Little Fat Fuck was still such a lovable glutton even in his weakened state. Back then, he had killed so many people and plundered so many stars that feeding his baby was never a concern.\n\nNow, though, it wasn’t that simple anymore.\n\nBeing a member of a village like this was nice. But it also restricted him from doing what he knew best: killing.\n\nKevin looked at the sky again, eyes squinting. Too few aether stars. He couldn’t feed his little whale like this. Sooner or later, Little Fat Fuck would start eating his own aether stars, crippling his tool to produce stat crystals.\n\nKevin needed to start killing soon. Either bandits or beasts and monsters with skill on them.\n\nHe wished the aether stars he had plundered without using his technique could also generate energy to produce crystals. But they couldn’t, so he could only feed them to his baby.\n\nAt the thought of stat crystals, he shifted his gaze toward the pulsating stars that were funneling energy toward his star lines. With a swipe of his hand, he pulled up the panel for energy distribution toward creating crystals.\n\nTo his surprise, the panel showed a setting identical to his previous life. 50% of the energy was put toward Soul Path Lines, 25% was put toward Time Path Lines, and the rest was equally distributed among the others.\n\nThis got him thinking. Did the system come back with him through the regression? Was that even possible? Well, he knew nothing of the system, so maybe the omniscient god could do so easily.\n\nKevin slapped his forehead. He felt so dumb for only realizing this now.\n\nThe system *did* come back with him. That was how he had retained his Mastery and star lines. It didn’t make sense otherwise.\n\n“Thank you, system.” Kevin clapped his hands in gratitude before shifting his attention back to the energy panel.\n\nSince it was unlikely that he could get his hands on a Soul Path or Time Path skill soon, he should redistribute the energy. Soul Path Crystals would mark him as a demonic strider. Time Path Crystals, however, could be used as a tool for negotiation or as an emergency fund. After all, anything related to Time Path was rare and valuable.\n\nWhat of his other Paths?\n\n“Refinement, Weapon, Fire, and Earth,” he mumbled.\n\nRefinement Crystals were useful, but his village had an abundance of them. Their value here wasn’t that great. The same with Earth Crystals. Weapon and Fire had potential, but only once the caravan arrived.\n\nAn idea clicked inside Kevin’s mind.\n\nThe caravan. Yes. That was what he should aim for with his crystals.\n\nLaughing to himself, Kevin pushed every last bit of energy from his stars into producing Time Path Crystals. His aether stars thrummed in union like a chorus of beating hearts as the system redirected their output toward only the Time Path star lines. The lines themselves shone and emanated an aura of nights long past and of days yet to come.\n\nWith C grade aptitude, his crystal production speed was painfully slower than the average. He had to do this if he wanted to have at least two, possibly three, Time Path Crystals ready before the caravan’s arrival.\n\nKevin rubbed his hands like an evil mastermind. Now, he only had to wait.\n\nWait. He had gotten completely sidetracked. He was going to cultivate.\n\nHe put his little whale back down and sat cross-legged beneath his Aether Tree. With but a thought, he lifted the skills playing in his essence pool out of it and placed them down next to him. They looked at him questioningly.\n\n“I’m cultivating, wait for a bit.”\n\nKevin took complete control of his entire essence pool. With another thought, every drop of essence flew upward. A reverse seven-colored rain rushed skyward, startling his Rank 1 skills. He wasn’t sure, but it seemed like Little Fat Fuck just rolled his eyes at them. Amateurs, his baby must have thought.\n\n*Is this what it felt like to be a proud father?*\n\nThe inverted rain surged toward his first aether lake, seeping into it, merging with it. Slowly, the seven colors started to spread across the colorless lake like ink bleeding into clear water. Now, all of his essence was inside his first lake.\n\nBeads of sweat rolled down Kevin’s face, neck, and back, soaking him, making his tunic cling uncomfortably close to his skin. But his full attention was locked on suffusing his aether lake with essence.\n\nIt was going smoothly. The lake was slowly turning.\n\nThat was when it felt like he had slammed his face into a wall while speeding as fast as a racecar. A clump of air choked his throat, making him gag. He quickly coughed it out and turned his focus inward again.\n\nA battle was raging in his aether lake.\n\nHis essence was warring for control against the constellations that made up his star lines. Much to his surprise, a part of his essence evaporated right after it finished refining a constellation.\n\nAlarms rang in his mind. In his previous life, he had never faced this problem.\n\nAs a Rank 1, his essence had only needed to fuse with his first lake to replace it and send the original lake upward. He hadn’t needed to refine his first Star Line until he was a Rank 3 Middle Stage.\n\nBut now? Not only did he have multiple star lines as a Rank 1, but he also had two of the highest quality and four of the average quality.\n\n*Curse you, Kevin. Curse you and your mastery.* The situation drew a chuckle out of him. Nothing was ever easy.\n\n“Well,” he grabbed his reward pouch, “that’s what money is for.”\n\nKevin pulled out a handful of aether coins. The seven-colored coins shimmered with seven-colored gleams even in low light. They were cold to the touch, almost like ice.\n\nKevin willed it, and the coins in his hand started melting. Within his inner space, his essence pool was refilled.\n\nOnce again, he sent his essence skyward and merged into his first lake. The battle continued as he burned the money he had just gotten whenever his essence got depleted. He repeated the process mechanically, nonstop.\n\nTime lost all meaning. When Kevin noticed it, the last constellation in his star lines had finally been refined. The two lakes now overlapped. star lines within them blurred as if they were hidden behind a thin fog.\n\nHe willed it, and the colorless lake shot upward, carrying star lines with it. The lake rose to a height equal to the distance between the crown of his tree and his seven-colored lake below, then stopped.\n\nNow, within his inner space, there were two aether lakes. The lower one swirled seven colors and had faint images of constellations gliding across it from one side to the other, a shadow of the true star lines above. The upper, colorless one was bigger than before. Its surface thrummed with sleeping potential.\n\n**\\*\\*Ding! You have reached Rank 1 – Middle Stage**\n\nKevin let out a long breath before he opened his eyes. When he started his cultivation, it was barely past noon. Now, the Moon Sisters hung proudly in the sky.\n\nHe had done it, reaching Rank 1 Middle Stage within a week of awakening his inner space. If the chief and elders knew this, they would go insane and pour every ounce of resources into making him a Rank 5.\n\nBut he knew his aptitude well.\n\nIf it weren’t for the fact that he had skipped the Early Stage and that he knew exactly what to do to increase his cultivation safely in the most efficient way, which played a major role in his quick advancement.\n\nNot to mention the critical support from his money.\n\nKevin turned to look at the pouch in his hand. During his advancement, he had let his brain run on autopilot, not noticing how many coins he had used. Though, the consumption rate shouldn’t be too bad.\n\nHe looked into the pouch and started counting. Five, ten, twenty… A hundred and two.\n\nKevin raised his head and stared at the ceiling. Then he closed his eyes and sighed deeply.\n\nIt was only to get from one minor realm to the other at Rank 1, yet he had burned half of his small fortune. The fact that he had to claw for every scrap to earn his keep, as he had no allowance, unlike students in Kassa’s class, was also an inconvenience.\n\nFrom now on, his expenditure was only going to rise as he climbed in Rank. Not to mention the mounting cost of raising and feeding his skills.\n\nHe needed a way to make money. *A* *lot* of it.\n\nBut how? The Ice Path legacy dungeon was a possible answer, but he had to find it first. Sadly, it was only late autumn, and the dungeon only revealed itself during winter.\n\nWhat else could he do right now?\n\nKevin sat and thought about it. There were two things.\n\nNow that he was a Rank 1 Middle Stage with two skills, he could subdue a group of bandits and make them clean up the other bandits in the surrounding mountains and plunder their resources for himself.\n\nIt was dangerous to travel in the mountains, but it was their problem, not his.\n\nThere was something else that could get him more coins. But that would depend on whether he was successful in making elder Aron teach him smithing or not.\n\nHe was confident with his smithing skills, but revealing them without a plausible excuse would draw too much attention.\n\nSpending time smithing would reduce the time he got to search for the Legacy. Could he force the bandits to search for him? Possibly.\n\nKevin stood up and walked to the table. He took out a piece of paper and pen and started drafting his plan. Before he began, Kevin checked his Status.\n\n**===============**\n\n**Status:**\n\n**Name:** Kevin Apocalyse\n\n**Rank:** 1 – Early -> 1 – Middle\n\n**Aptitude:** C – 12%\n\n**Mastery:**\n\n**Master:** Soul Path\n\n**Expert:** Time Path\n\n**Adept:** Refinement Path, Weapon Path, Fire Path, Earth Path\n\n**Novice:** Lightning Path (new)\n\n**Star lines:**\n\n**Bright:** Soul Path, Time Path\n\n**Clear:** Refinement Path, Weapon Path, Fire Path, Earth Path\n\n**Faint:** None\n\n**Core Skill:** Star Devouring – Rank 6\n\n**Skills:**\n\nRank 1\n\nLightning Spike (new)\n\nLightning Step (new)\n\nEarth Wall (new)\n\n**Advanced Skill Forms:**\n\nNexus Art\n\nAvailable:\n\nUnavailable:\n\nSoul Path: Shredding Soul, Soul Shell Retaliation, True Soul Suppression\n\nSoul Path + Time Path: Dead Star Plundering\n\n**===============**\n\nA slow smile spread across his face. The time for bandit hunting was approaching.\n\n  \n[First ](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nsh8uy/awakened_insanity_blurb_and_chapter_1/)| [Previous ](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1o1tqgi/awakened_insanity_chapter_13/)| Next\n\n[Royal Road](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/134795/awakened-insanity-coming-in-3-days) | [Patreon](http://patreon.com/LeeLK)\n\nThanks for reading.

    "content": "I have been an advocate of Railgun for several months now and in the last couple of weeks. I have been pointing out on here that Railgun ($RAIL) is the next moonshot. However time is running out as in 3days Railgun token price has jumped from $1.16 to $4.58. Why should you watch this token:\n\n1. Inherent value - Railgun has inhenet value. In 2022 it was used to mask $100M+ in transactions. In 2023 that rose to several $100M. In 2024 $1Bn+. This year is already at $2Bn+. If so many people are trusting this network as a privacy layer for their wealth. Surely its worth something right?\n\n2. Credibility and Trust - Railgun has a highly accomplished and experience team of engineers. Railgun has seen backing from technology leaders such as Vitalik Buterin, who both uses Railgun for privacy and also has donated several million dollars to the cause.\n\nSo what kind of Market Cap will Railgun max out at? With all the above points taken into account, and then looking at the market cap of Zcash ($3.7Bn) and Monero ($6Bn) and saying the market overall doesn't move. Railgun could easily see a $2.3Bn Market cap. However many believe the Crypto market is still likely to double in the next 12 months and there is no reason $RAIL couldn't match Monero.\n\nSo a conservative estimate of 10x growth - $2.3Bn Market Cap.\n\nA more ambitious estimate of 55x growth - $12.6Bn Market Cap.\n\nIf you are serious about getting more wealth, go and do some research into what I have said and then you will see this is a safer bet and just as lucrative as any meme coin.",
